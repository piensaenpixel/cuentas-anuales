## APPENDIX X Information on data derived from the special accounting registry 

Information required pursuant to Circular 5/2011 of the Bank of Spain is indicated as follows. 

### a) Mortgage market policies and procedures 

The Bank has express policies and procedures in place regarding its activities in the mortgage market, which provide for full compliance with applicable regulations. 

The mortgage origination policy is based in principles focused on assessing the adequate ratio between the amount of the loan, and the payments, and the income of the applicant. Applicants must in all cases prove sufficient repayment ability (present and future) to meet their repayment obligations, for both the mortgage debt and for other debts detected in the financial system. Therefore, the applicant’s repayment ability is a key aspect within the credit decision-making tools and retail risk acceptance manuals, and has a high weighting in the final decision.  

During the mortgage risk transaction analysis process, documentation supporting the applicant’s income (payroll, etc.) is required, and the applicant’s position in the financial system is checked through automated database queries (internal and external). This information is used for calculation purposes in order to determine the level of indebtedness/compliance with the remainder of the system. This documentation is kept in the transaction’s file. 

In addition, the mortgage origination policy assesses the adequate ratio between the amount of the loan and the appraisal value of the mortgaged asset. The policy also establishes that the property to be mortgaged be appraised by an independent appraisal company as established by Circular 3/2010 and Circular 4/2016. BBVA selects those companies whose reputation, standing in the market and independence ensure that their appraisals adapt to the market reality in each region. Each appraisal is reviewed and checked before the loan is granted by BBVA staff and, in those cases where the loan is finally granted, it is kept in the transaction’s file. 

As for issues related to the mortgage market, the Group’s Finance Division annually defines the wholesale finance issue strategy, and more specifically mortgage bond issues, such as mortgage covered bonds or mortgage securitization. The Assets and Liabilities Committee (“ALCO”) tracks the budget monthly. The volume and type of assets in these transactions is determined in accordance with the wholesale finance plan, the trend of the Bank’s “Loans and receivables” outstanding balances and market conditions. 

The Board of the Bank authorizes each of the issues of Mortgage Transfer Certificate and/or Mortgage Participation issued by BBVA to securitize loans and mortgage loans, Likewise, the Board of Directors authorize, under the power delegated by the Annual General Meeting held on March 13, 2015 under item three of the agenda, the establishment of a Base Prospectus for the issue of fixed-income securities through which the mortgage-covered bonds are implemented. 

As established in article 24 of Royal Decree 716/2009, the volume of outstanding mortgage-covered bonds issued by a bank may not exceed 80% of a calculation base determined by adding the outstanding principal of all the loans and mortgage loans in the bank’s portfolio that are eligible and are not covered by the issue of Mortgage Bonds, Mortgage Participations or Mortgage Transfer Certificates. For these purposes, in accordance with the aforementioned Royal Decree 716/2009, in order to be eligible, loans and mortgage loans must, on a general basis: (i) be secured by a first mortgage on the freehold; (ii) the loan’s amount may not exceed 80% of the appraisal value for home mortgages, and 60% for other mortgage lending; (iii) be established on assets exclusively and wholly owned by the mortgagor; (iv) have been appraised by an independent appraisal company unrelated to the Group and authorized by the Bank of Spain; and (v) the mortgaged property must be covered at least by a current damage insurance policy.  

The Bank has set up a series of controls for mortgage covered bonds, which regularly control the total volume of issued mortgage covered bonds issued and the remaining eligible collateral, to avoid exceeding the maximum limit set by Royal Decree 716/2009, and outlined in the preceding paragraph. In the case of securitizations, the preliminary portfolio of loans and mortgage loans to be securitized is checked according to an agreed procedures engagement, by the Bank’s external auditor as required by the Spanish Securities and Exchange Commission. There is also a series of filters through which some mortgage loans and credits are excluded in accordance with legal, commercial and risk concentration criteria.
