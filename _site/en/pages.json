Stock markets in the United States again posted record highs while the dollar gained value, which helped the bullish trend on European markets to gain traction. This behavior seems to be pricing in the potential positive economic effects of ramped up fiscal stimuli in the United States, together with stabilizing oil prices. Sovereign bond yields remain on the rise in nearly all countries, led by the United States, where they have been supported by rising inflation expectations and faster growth, together with prospects of a tighter monetary policy. In fact, the market has already priced in four 25-basis point interest-rate hikes in the United States over 2017 and 2018. Furthermore, the ECB also announced plans to scale back the pace of sovereign bond purchases.ActivityAll the comments below on rates of change, for both activity and earnings, will be given at constant exchange rate, unless expressly stated otherwise. These rates, together with changes at the current exchange rate, can be seen in the attached tables of financial statements and relevant business indicators.The market context remains unchanged, with margins being squeezed (negative interest rates in Europe) and excess liquidity. In this situation, gross lending to customers ended the year slightly below last year’s level (down 1.2%). There was significant double-digit growth in Mexico, contrasting with declines in Europe and Asia.The NPL ratio improved in the last quarterof the year. As of 31-Dec-2016 it stood at1.0%, while the coverage ratio closed theyear at 79% (1.4% and 83% respectivelyon 31-Sep-2016, and 1.4% and 86% on31-Dec-2015).There was a slowdown in the fall in customer deposits under management, which had been declining over the first nine months of 2016. At year-end these stood 5.3% lower than at the close of 2015, shaped by the performance in the United States (down 22.7%), Eurasia (down 16.3%) and Mexico (down 8.1%). This contrasts with significant growth in Spain (up 9.4%).Financial statements and relevant business indicatorsMillion euros and percentageIncome statement2016∆%∆% (1)2015Net interest income1,283(12.2)(5.7)1,463Net fees and commissions620(7.5)(1.6)670Net trading income6607.320.9615Other income/expenses11721.514.996Gross income2,680(5.7)1.62,844Operating expenses(1,020)2.46.1(996)Personnel expenses(529)3.46.5(512)General and administrative expenses(391)(2.6)1.8(402)Depreciation(100)20.023.1(83)Operating income1,660(10.1)(1.0)1,847Impairment on financial assets (net)(231)85.590.0(125)Provisions (net) and other gains (losses)(65)n.s.n.s.(9)Income before tax1,364(20.4)(11.8)1,713Income tax(391)(22.1)(12.8)(502)Net income973(19.7)(11.4)1,211Non-controlling interests(112)(23.0)(6.6)(145)Net attributable profit861(19.2)(11.9)1,066Download tableMajor balance sheet items31-12-16∆%∆% (1) 31-12-15Cash and balances with central banks, credit institutions and others30,302(1.2)0.630,664Financial assets82,666(8.5)(7.1)90,367Loans and advances to customers58,3860.81.757,944Inter-area positions----Tangible assets35(22.0)(16.0)45Other assets2,492(35.0)(36.1)3,837Off-balance sheet funds173,882(4.9)(3.6)182,856Deposits from central banks and credit institutions43,705(19.6)(17.1)54,362Deposits from customers47,765(9.6)(8.3)52,851Debt certificates(26)(28.9)(36.0)(36)Subordinated liabilities2,2649.119.72,075Inter-area positions17,50483.078.09,568Financial liabilities held for trading54,782(0.9)(1.1)55,274Other liabilities3,813(9.4)(7.2)4,207Economic capital allocated4,074(10.6)(8.3)4,557Download tableRelevant business indicators31-12-16∆%∆% (1) 31-12-15Loans and advances to customers (gross) (2)53,118(2.1)(1.2)54,281Customer deposits under management (2)40,545(6.7)(5.3)43,478Off-balance sheet funds (3)1,1576.78.91,084Efficiency ratio (%38.1&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;35.0NPL ratio (%)1.0&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.4NPL coverage ratio (%))79&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;86Cost of risk (%))0.12&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0.21Download table(1) Figures at constant exchange rates.

The most significant aspects of the CIB income statement are as follows:Gross income in the fourth quarter was higher than the previous quarter (up 14.0%), due to good management of market volatility by the Global Markets teams. In year-on-year terms, the cumulative amount in 2016 is 1.6% higher than in the previous year, despite low market activity, with little new production in the purely banking business and a lack of one-off transactions, particularly in Europe.One of the actions taken by the CIB to address this market reality was the Deep Blue plan, which has had very positive results since its launch. This cross-cutting initiative is designed to involve several CIB teams in visits to clients (more than 60 visits in Europe, the United States and Latin America) to offer them the solutions that best fit their needs. Underwriting instructions worth €40.000m have been submitted as a result of this plan, which are being monitored on a recurrent basis.The Global Markets unit posted an outstanding performance, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2016, generating gross income that was 35.8% higher than in the third quarter, thanks to good management of market volatility, particularly in the United States and Mexico following the United States elections and interest rate hikes in both geographic areas. In cumulative terms, gross income from the unit has risen by 4.0% in the last twelve months.As regards Corporate Finance, the final part of the year has been marked by low levels of activity in the Spanish primary market and political uncertainty in Mexico. During the fourth quarter the unit continued its busy marketing efforts, which have seen it win two mandates to manage IPOs for corporate clients in Spain (planned for the first quarter 2017). As for mergers &amp;amp; acquisitions (M&amp;amp;A) activity, during the fourth quarter the pipeline of operations continued to grow, largely driven by interest in countries such as Spain and Mexico. BBVA was one of the busiest M&amp;amp;A consultants in Spain in 2016, according to the rankings prepared by Thomson Reuters, Mergermarket, Dealogic and Bloomberg.Cumulative operating expenses were up 6.1% against 2015, chiefly due to technology costs associated with investment plans.Lastly, significant provisions were made during the year for impairment losses on financial assets, mainly because of the rating downgrades (particularly in the first quarter of 2016) affecting some companies in the United States operating in the energy (exploration &amp;amp; production) and metals &amp;amp; mining (basic materials) sectors. This is the main reason for the increase in this heading over the last twelve months.Conciliation of the BBVA Group’s financial statementsPresented below is the reconciliation between the consolidated income statement and the management income statement, which is shown throughout this management report for the year 2015. The main difference between both is the method used for integrating Garanti’s earnings. In the management income statement, the Group’s earnings were presented by consolidating Garanti in the proportion corresponding to the percentage held by BBVA Group in the Turkish bank until the first half of 2015 (25,01%), versus the integration using the equity method in the consolidated income statement. The “results from corporate operations” heading in the management income statement for the year 2015 includes the capital gains from the various sale operations equivalent to 6.34% of BBVA Group’s stake in CNCB, the badwill from the CX operation, the effect of the valuation at fair value of the 25,01% initial stake held by BBVA in Garanti and the impact of the sale of BBVA’s 29.68% stake in CIFH. In the consolidated income statement, these earnings are included under profit from continuing operations.Conciliation of the BBVA Group’s income statements. 2015Million eurosAdjustmetsConsolidated income statementsGaranti integrated proportionallyGaranti by the equity methodCorporate operations (1)Management income statementsInterest and similar income24,7831,062&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;25,845Financial incomeGInterest and similar expenses(8,761)(658)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(9,419)Financial expensesNet interest income16,022404&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;16,426Net interest incomeDividend income415&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;415Dividend incomeShare of profit or loss of entities accounted for using the equity method1741(167)&amp;nbsp;8Share of profit or loss of entities accounted for using the equity methodFee and commission income6,340&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Fee and commission expenses(1,729)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4,61194&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4,705Net fees and commissionsGains or (-) losses on financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, net(409)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Gains or (-) losses on financial assets and liabilities held for trading, net126&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Gains or (-) losses on derecognition of financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value through profit or loss, net1,055&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Gains or losses from hedge accounting, net93&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Exchange differences (net)1,165&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2,030(21)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2,009Net trading income Other operating income and expenses(970)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Income on insurance and reinsurance contracts1,079&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1098&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;117 Other operating income and expensesGross income23,362485(167)&amp;nbsp;23,680Gross incomeAdministration expenses(10,836)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(12,317)Operating expenses Personnel expenses(6,273)(104) &amp;nbsp;(6,377)Personnel expensesOther general and administrative expenses(4,563)(87)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(4,650)General and administrative expensesDepreciation(1,272)(18)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(1,290)Depreciation&amp;nbsp;11,254276(167)&amp;nbsp;11,363Operating incomeProvisions or reversal of provisions(731)(2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(733) Provisions (net)Impairment or reversal of impairment on financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss(4,272)(67)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(4,339)Impairment on financial assets (net)Net operating income6,25140&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6,291&amp;nbsp;Impairment or reversal of impairment on non-financial assets(273)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Gains (losses) on derecognized assets not classified as non-current assets held for sale(2,135)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Negative goodwill recognised in profit or loss26&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Profit or (-) loss from non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale not qualifying as discontinued operations734&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(1,648)2&amp;nbsp;1,234(412)Other gains (losses)Profit from continuing operations4,603&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5,879Income before taxTax expense or income related to profit or loss from continuing operation(1,274)(43)&amp;nbsp;(124)(1,441)Income taxProfit from continuing operations3,328&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1,1094,438 Net income from ongoing operationsProfit from discontinued operations (net)-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-Net income from discontinued operations&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(1,109)Results from corporate operations (1)Profit3,328&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3,328Net incomeAttributable to minority interest (non-controlling interests)(686)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(686)Non-controlling interestsAttributable to owners of the parent2,642&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2,642Net attributable profitDownload table(1)2015 includes the capital gains from the various sale operations equivalent to 6.34% of BBVA Group’s stake in CNCB, the badwill from the CX operation, the effect of the valuation at fair value of the 25,01% initial stake held by BBVA in Garanti and the impact of the sale of BBVA’s 29.68% stake in CIFH.",

YEAR15,85611,108[Download table](#)## APPENDIX X Information on data derived from the special accounting registry Information required pursuant to Circular 5/2011 of the Bank of Spain is indicated as follows. ### a) Mortgage market policies and procedures The Bank has express policies and procedures in place regarding its activities in the mortgage market, which provide for full compliance with applicable regulations. The mortgage origination policy is based in principles focused on assessing the adequate ratio between the amount of the loan, and the payments, and the income of the applicant. Applicants must in all cases prove sufficient repayment ability (present and future) to meet their repayment obligations, for both the mortgage debt and for other debts detected in the financial system. Therefore, the applicant’s repayment ability is a key aspect within the credit decision-making tools and retail risk acceptance manuals, and has a high weighting in the final decision.During the mortgage risk transaction analysis process, documentation supporting the applicant’s income (payroll, etc.) is required, and the applicant’s position in the financial system is checked through automated database queries (internal and external). This information is used for calculation purposes in order to determine the level of indebtedness/compliance with the remainder of the system. This documentation is kept in the transaction’s file. In addition, the mortgage origination policy assesses the adequate ratio between the amount of the loan and the appraisal value of the mortgaged asset. The policy also establishes that the property to be mortgaged be appraised by an independent appraisal company as established by Circular 3/2010 and Circular 4/2016. BBVA selects those companies whose reputation, standing in the market and independence ensure that their appraisals adapt to the market reality in each region. Each appraisal is reviewed and checked before the loan is granted by BBVA staff and, in those cases where the loan is finally granted, it is kept in the transaction’s file. As for issues related to the mortgage market, the Group’s Finance Division annually defines the wholesale finance issue strategy, and more specifically mortgage bond issues, such as mortgage covered bonds or mortgage securitization. The Assets and Liabilities Committee (“ALCO”) tracks the budget monthly. The volume and type of assets in these transactions is determined in accordance with the wholesale finance plan, the trend of the Bank’s “Loans and receivables” outstanding balances and market conditions. The Board of the Bank authorizes each of the issues of Mortgage Transfer Certificate and/or Mortgage Participation issued by BBVA to securitize loans and mortgage loans, Likewise, the Board of Directors authorize, under the power delegated by the Annual General Meeting held on March 13, 2015 under item three of the agenda, the establishment of a Base Prospectus for the issue of fixed-income securities through which the mortgage-covered bonds are implemented. As established in article 24 of Royal Decree 716/2009, the volume of outstanding mortgage-covered bonds issued by a bank may not exceed 80% of a calculation base determined by adding the outstanding principal of all the loans and mortgage loans in the bank’s portfolio that are eligible and are not covered by the issue of Mortgage Bonds, Mortgage Participations or Mortgage Transfer Certificates. For these purposes, in accordance with the aforementioned Royal Decree 716/2009, in order to be eligible, loans and mortgage loans must, on a general basis: (i) be secured by a first mortgage on the freehold; (ii) the loan’s amount may not exceed 80% of the appraisal value for home mortgages, and 60% for other mortgage lending; (iii) be established on assets exclusively and wholly owned by the mortgagor; (iv) have been appraised by an independent appraisal company unrelated to the Group and authorized by the Bank of Spain; and (v) the mortgaged property must be covered at least by a current damage insurance policy.The Bank has set up a series of controls for mortgage covered bonds, which regularly control the total volume of issued mortgage covered bonds issued and the remaining eligible collateral, to avoid exceeding the maximum limit set by Royal Decree 716/2009, and outlined in the preceding paragraph. In the case of securitizations, the preliminary portfolio of loans and mortgage loans to be securitized is checked according to an agreed procedures engagement, by the Bank’s external auditor as required by the Spanish Securities and Exchange Commission. There is also a series of filters through which some mortgage loans and credits are excluded in accordance with legal, commercial and risk concentration criteria. ### b) Quantitative information on activities in the mortgage market The quantitative information on activities in the mortgage market required by Bank of Spain Circular 5/2011 is shown below.#### b,1) Ongoing operationsMillions of EurosMortgage loans.

      "content"  : "Business areasThis section presents and analyzes the most relevant aspects of the Group’s different business areas. Specifically, it shows a summary of the income statement and balance sheet, the business activity figures and the most significant ratios in each of them.In 2016 the reporting structure of BBVA Group’s business areas remains basically the same as in 2015:Banking activity in Spain includes, as in previous years, the Retail Network in Spain, Corporate and Business Banking (CBB), Corporate &amp;amp; Investment Banking (CIB), BBVA Seguros and Asset Management units in Spain. It also includes the portfolios, finance and structural interest-rate positions of the euro balance sheet.Real-estate activity in Spain covers specialist management of real-estate assets in the country (excluding buildings for own use), including: foreclosed real-estate assets from residential mortgages and developers; as well as lending to developers.The United States includes the Group’s business activity in the country through the BBVA Compass group and the BBVA New York branch.Turkey includes the activity of the Garanti Group. BBVA’s stake in Garanti (39.9% since the third quarter of 2015) has been incorporated into the Group’s financial statements since then by the full integration method. The above has had an impact on the year-on-year rates of change in the earnings of this area due to the change in the scope of consolidation. In order to make the comparison against 2015 easier, rates of change are shown by taking into account the stake in Garanti on an equivalent basis, i.e. including the stake in Garanti as if it had been incorporated by the full integration method since January 1, 2015 (Turkey in comparable terms).Mexico includes all the banking, real-estate and insurance businesses carried out by the Group in the country.South America basically includes BBVA’s banking and insurance businesses in the region.The rest of Eurasia includes business activity in the rest of Europe and Asia, i.e. the Group’s retail and wholesale businesses in the area.In addition to the above, all the areas include a remainder made up basically of other businesses and a supplement that includes deletions and allocations not assigned to the units making up the above areas.Lastly, the Corporate Center is an aggregate that contains the rest of the items that have not been allocated to the business areas, as it basically corresponds to the Group’s holding function. It includes: the costs of the head offices that have a corporate function; management of structural exchange-rate positions; specific issues of equity instruments to ensure adequate management of the Group’s global solvency; portfolios and their corresponding results, whose management is not linked to customer relations, such as industrial holdings; certain tax assets and liabilities; funds due to commitments with employees; goodwill and other intangibles. It also comprises the result from certain corporate operations carried out by the Group in 2015.In addition to this geographical breakdown, supplementary information is provided for all the wholesale businesses carried out by BBVA, i.e. Corporate &amp;amp; Investment Banking (CIB), in all the geographical areas where it operates. This aggregate business is considered relevant to better understand the Group because of the characteristics of the customers served, the type of products offered and the risks assumed.Lastly, as usual, in the case of the Americas, Turkey and CIB areas, the results of applying constant exchange rates are given in addition to the year-on-year variations at current exchange rates.The information by areas is based on units at the lowest level and/or companies making up the Group, which are assigned to the different areas according to the geographical area in which they carry out their activity.Major income statement items by business areaMillion eurosBusiness areas&amp;nbsp;BBVA Group (1)Banking activity in SpainReal-estate activityin SpainThe United StatesTurkey (1)MexicoSouth AmericaRest of EurasiaΣ Business areasCorporate Center2016&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Net interest income17,0593,883601,9533,4045,1262,93016617,521(461)Gross income24,6536,445(6)2,7064,2576,7664,05449124,713(60)Operating income11,8622,846(130)8632,5194,3712,16014912,778(916)Income before tax6,3921,278(743)6121,9062,6781,5522037,486(1,094)Net attributable profit3,475912(595)4595991,9807711514,276(801)2015&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Net interest income16,4264,001711,8112,1945,3873,20218316,850(424)Gross income23,6806,804(28)2,6312,4347,0814,47747323,872(192)Operating income11,3633,358(154)8251,2734,4592,49812112,380(1,017)Income before tax5,8791,548(716)6858532,7721,8141117,066(1,187)Net attributable profit2,6421,085(496)5173712,094905754,552(1,910)Download table(1) From the third quarter of 2015, BBVA’s total stake in Garanti is consolidated by the full integration method.

Calculation of risk adjusted return per transaction, customer, product, segment, unit and/or business area is sustained on ERC, which is based on the concept of unexpected loss at a specific confidence level, dependingon the Group’s capital adequacy targets. The calculation of the ERC combines credit risk, market risk, structuralbalance-sheet risk, equity positions, operational risk,fixed-asset risk and technical risks in the case of insurance companies. These calculations are carried out using internal models that have been defined following the guidelines and requirements established under the Basel III capital accord.Internal transfer prices. BBVA Group has a transfer prices system whose general principles apply in the Bank’s different entities, business areas and units. Within each geographical area, internal transfer rates are established to calculate the net interest income of its businesses, under both the asset and liability headings. These rates consist of a reference rate (an index whose use is generally accepted on the market) that is applied based on the transaction’s revision period or maturity, and a liquidity premium, i.e. a spread that is established based on the conditions and outlook of the financial markets. Additionally, there are agreements for the allocation of earnings between the product-generating units and the distribution units.Allocation of operating expenses. Both direct and indirect costs are allocated to the business areas, except where there is no clearly defined relationship with the businesses, i.e. when they are of a clearly corporate or institutional nature for the Group as a whole.Cross-selling. In some cases, adjustments are required to eliminate shadow accounting entries that are registered in the earnings of two or more units as a result of cross-selling incentives.Interest rates (Quarterly averages.

Domestic demand continues to be solid.The family and corporate deleveraging process continues in the financial system, although at a slower pace than in previous years. According to data as of October 2016, total domestic private-sector loans fell by 4.8% in year-on-year terms. Nevertheless, the trend for growth in new loan operations to families and SMEs starting in January 2014 continues, and the amount increased by 5.2% on November 2015. However, the total amount of new operations fell by 13.3% between January and November 2016, due to the fall in new loans to large companies. The asset quality indicators in the system continue to improve. The NPL ratio in the sector stood at 9.3% in October, 0,85 percentage points below the figure at the close of 2015, due to the significant reduction in non-performing loans (down 16.3% year-on-year and 40% since the high in December 2013). The environment of all-time low interest rates continues to put pressure on profitability in the system, with a ROE of 4.8% as of September 2016. Finally, use of Eurosystem liquidity by Spanish entities is relatively stable: €135,987m as of November 2016, practically the same figure as one year earlier.ActivityGross customer lending has declined, inyear-on-year terms, by 3.7%, closely linked to the reduction in the mortgage and public-sector portfolios and the balance of non-performing loans. However, it should be noted that new loan production has been positive over the year, showing year-on-year growth of 5.5% in mortgages (a rise not sufficient to increase stock, which is still declining at rates similar to previous quarters, down 4.0% year-on-year) and 36.2% in consumer finance (a portfolio whose final volume has grown by 18.0% as of 31-Dec-2016).As regards asset quality, the reduction in the NPL ratio continues: down 12 basis points over the last quarter and 86 basis points in the last twelve months. The coverage ratio closed the year above 53%.Customer deposits under management have grown by 2.5% in year-on-year terms in 2016, largely due to the good performance of current and savings accounts (up 21.8%). Time deposit balances have declined by 14.4% as a result of the reduced remuneration in this kind of deposits.Finally, off-balance sheet funds have grown by 3.0% year-on-year, most notably in the fourth quarter (up 2.6% on the previous quarter). Mutual funds grew by 3.7% and pensions funds by 2.4%.Financial statements and relevant business indicatorsMillion euros and percentageIncome statement2016∆%2015Net interest income3,883(2.9)4,001Net fees and commissions1,500(6.5)1,605Net trading income787(22.3)1,013Other income/expenses27548.6185Gross income6,445(5.3)6,804Operating expenses(3,599)4.4(3,446)Personnel expenses(2,011)5.5(1,907)Other administrative expenses (1,268)8.4(1,170)Depreciation(319)(13.3)(368)Operating income2,846(15.2)3,358Impairment on financial assets (net)(763)(42.7)(1,332)Provisions (net) and other gains (losses)(805)68.6(478)Income before tax1,278(17.5)1,548Income tax(363)(20.4)(456)Net income915(16.2)1,092Non-controlling interests(3)(52.9)(6)Net attributable profit912(16.0)1,085Download tableMajor balance sheet items31-12-16∆%31-12-15Cash and balances with central banks, credit institutions and others45,59032.934,298Financial assets100,394(14.7)117,631Loans and advances to customers181,243(1.6)184,115Inter-area positions1,996188.3692Tangible assets78812.2702Other assets2,63212.62,338Total assets/liabilities and equity332,642(2.1)339,775Deposits from central banks and credit institutions66,02911.159,456Deposits from customers177,149(4.5)185,484Debt certificates35,980(13.1)41,422Subordinated liabilities2,3650.82,347Inter-area positions---Financial liabilities held for trading39,829(0.3)39,955Other liabilities1,8811.41,854Economic capital allocated9,4091.69,259Download tableRelevant business indicators31-12-16∆%31-12-15Loans and advances to customers (gross) (1)180,707(3.7)187,719Customer deposits under management (1) 171,2102.5167,026Off-balance sheet funds (2)56,1473.054,504Risk-weighted assets113,048(7.3)121,889Efficiency ratio (%) 55.8&amp;nbsp;50.6NPL ratio (%)5.8&amp;nbsp;6.6NPL coverage ratio (%)53&amp;nbsp;59Cost of risk (%)0.32&amp;nbsp;0.71Download table(1) Excluding repos. (2) Includes mutual funds, pension funds and other off-balance sheet funds.EarningsEarnings in the area are affected by the recognition of the provision to cover the possible future claims that customers could file related to the judgment by the CJEU on “mortgage floor clauses” in loans with consumers. Apart from this, the most relevant aspects of the account in 2016 are:The decline in yield on loans is still not offset by cheaper funding, whether retail (reduced cost of deposits) or wholesale. The above, combined with lower volume of loans, explains the year-on-year decrease of 2.9% in cumulative net interest income for 2016, despite the fact that it grew slightly in the last quarter (up 0.3%).In a complex environment such as that of 2016, income from fees and commissions declined by 6.5%. This fall is closely linked to market movements and reduced activity in securities and investment banking.The contribution of NTI is lower than in 2015, due mainly to lower sales of ALCO portfolios. The Global Markets unit has performed particularly well, above all in the last quarter of the year. As a result, theyear-on-year decline in this heading is below that in the cumulative figure through the third quarter of 2016.Other income/expenses have grown by 48.6% year-on-year, partly due to the positive performance of income from insurance activities in the last twelve months and a reduced annual contribution to the Single Resolution Fund (–€117m before tax) booked in the second quarter of the year compared with the 2015 figure (in 2015 it was booked in the fourth quarter). The contribution to the Deposit Guarantee Fund in the fourth quarter is in line with that made in the same period last year.Operating expenses have fallen in the fourth quarter by 2.4% as a result of the synergies generated by the operational integration of CX. These synergies will be consolidated and become more visible over 2017. The behavior of this line in the cumulative figure for 2016 shows a year-on-year increase of 4.4%, very closely linked to the inclusion of CX in April 2015, and related integration costs.The continued improvement in asset quality has resulted in more limited impairment losses on financial assets (down 42.7%year-on-year). As a result, the cumulative cost of risk through December stands at 0.32%, a fall of 39 basis points on the previous year.Provisions (net) and other gains (losses) increased in 2016 year-on-year by 68.6%, due basically to the provision of €577m before tax to cover the contingency related to the aforementioned “mortgage floor clauses” (€404m after tax). This item also includes the costs resulting from the transformation process.As a result, the net attributable profit generated by banking activity in Spain in 2016 stands at €912m, a year-on-year reduction of 16.0%. Not including the provision for “mortgage floor clauses” mentioned above, there would have been an increase of 21.2% to €1,316m.Real-estate activity in SpainHighlightsThe growing trend in demand, prices and activity in the mortgage market continues.Further reduction in net exposure and NPLs in the area.Increased coverage for real-estate assets.Industry trendsAccording to the latest available information as of November 2016 from the General Council of Spanish Notaries, a total of 408,973 homes were sold in the first eleven months of the year, a year-on-year rise of 12.9%. This performance is slightly above the BBVA Research forecast, which initially estimated a year-on-year growth in sales in 2016 of around 10%.With respect to the latest data published by the National Institute for Statistics (INE) in the third quarter of 2016, the price of homes has grown 4.0% year-on-year. This is a similar rate to that of the previous quarter (up 3.9%), changing the moderation that began in the second quarter of 2016. Once more, theyear-on-year rise in the price of new construction (up 7.3%) is far greater than that of existing homes (up 3.5%).The mortgage market is still strong, thanks to increased sales in a context of low cost of finance, as interest rates remain at record low levels. The volume of new residential mortgage loans granted to families picked up to a year-on-year growth of 6.7% in November. Not including transactions whose conditions were renegotiated, new loans for homes in November posted a year-on-year rise of 19.3%. In the first eleven months of 2016 they grew by 21.5% on the figure for the same period in 2015.The figures related to construction activity show the number of construction permits approved in the first ten months of the year is 33.2% up on the same period in 2015.Net exposure to real estate (Million euros)(1) Transparency scope according to Bank of Spain Circular 5/2011 dated November 30.(2) Other foreclosed assets include foreclosed assets that do not stem from financing family home buying.Coverage of real-estate exposure in Spain (1)Million of euros as of 31-12-16Risk amountProvision% Coverage over riskNPL5,0952,88857Foreclosed real-estate and other assets14,2058,88463From real-estate developers8,0175,29066From dwellings4,3322,58860Other1,8561,00654Subtotal19,30011,77261Performing2,835562With collateral2,469482Finished properties1,800332Construction in progress42761Land24294Without collateral and other36682Real-estate exposure22,13511,82853Download table(1) Transparency scope according to Bank of Spain Circular 5/2011 dated November 30.ActivityBBVA continues with its strategy of reducing its net exposure to the real-estate sector in Spain, both in the developer segment (lending to real-estate developers plus foreclosed assets derived from those loans) and in foreclosed real-estate assets from retail mortgage loans. As of 31-Dec-2016, the amount stood at €10.307m (in accordance with the scope of transparency stipulated by Bank of Spain Circular 5/2011 dated November 30), a fall of 16.8% since December 2015. It has declined by 7.0% with respect to the figure for September 2016.Total real-estate exposure, including outstanding loans to developers, foreclosures and other assets, reflects a coverage ratio of 53% at the close of the fourth quarter of 2016, which represents an improvement of 3,2 percentage points with respect to the figure for 31-Dec-2015, and 2,1 percentage points against the ratio for 30-Sep-2016.Non-performing loans have fallen again in the fourth quarter and in the last twelve months, with new additions to NPL declining over the period and a coverage ratio of 57%.Sales of real-estate assets in the fourth quarter amounted to 3.340 units, and a total sales price of €340m. In the cumulative total for the year, the real-estate units sold increased by 37% with respect to 2015. The main levers in 2016 have been the implementation of commercial plans and actions designed to speed up sales and reduce the stock of product that has been on the Entity’s balance sheet for the longest time.EarningsThis business area posted a cumulative loss in 2016 of €595m, compared with a loss of €496m in 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2016, there was an increased allocation to provisions (net) and other gains (losses), due to a greater need for real-estate provisions, which has been partially offset by a lower figure for impairment losses on financial assets. Not including this effect, earnings in the area have improved due to the more favorable cost of funding in the asset portfolios and lower financed volumes as a result of reduced exposure.Financial statements Million eurosIncome statement2016∆%2015Net interest income60(16.2)71Net fees and commissions6138.92Net trading income(3)n.s.4Other income/expenses(68)(35.0)(105)Gross income(6)(76.5)(28)Operating expenses(124)(1.8)(126)Personnel expenses(66)1.7(64)Other administrative expenses (31)(16.5)(37)Depreciation(27)11.2(25)Operating income(130)(15.2)(154)Impairment on financial assets (net)(138)(23.1)(179)Provisions (net) and other gains (losses)(475)23.9(383)Income before tax(743)3.8(716)Income tax148(33.2)221Net income(595)20.3(495)Non-controlling interests(0)(84.9)(1)Net attributable profit(595)20.1(496)Download tableMajor balance sheet items31-12-16∆%31-12-15Cash and balances with central banks, credit institutions and others977.75Financial assets57535.1425Loans and advances to customers5,946(27.7)8,228Inter-area positions---Tangible assets464(64.3)1,302Other assets6,719(6.2)7,162Total assets/liabilities and equity13,713(19.9)17,122Deposits from central banks and credit institutions---Deposits from customers24(81.5)131Debt certificates---Subordinated liabilities834(2.7)857Inter-area positions9,520(25.1)12,708Financial liabilities held for trading0n.s.-Other liabilities(0)n.s.0Economic capital allocated3,335(2.7)3,427Pro memoria:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Risk-weighted assets10,988(24.8)14,606Download tableThe United StatesHighlightsFocus on selective and profitable growth continues.Good performance of deposits, especially in the fourth quarter.Improvement of risk indicators along the year.Business activity (Year-on-year change at constant exchange rate.Data as of 31-12-2016)Operating income (Million euros at constant exchange rate)(1) At current exchange rate: +4.6%Breakdown of loans an advances to customers (gross) (Percentage as of 31-12-2016)Net interes income/ATA (Percentage.

Private consumption is expected to continue to increase at a similar pace, supported by employment growth, easy credit, more limited inflationary pressures, and despite the important role that deleveraging will play. With respect to investment, lower earnings from companies and the adjustment in the energy and mining sector will continue to weigh on corporate decisions.In the currencies market, the uncertainty in the wake of the U.S. presidential elections and the FED’s normalization process led to a reversal of the depreciation of the dollar that had begun in the first quarter of the year. The dollar gained 3.3% against the euro over the last twelve months, in accordance with the year-end exchange rate as of 31-Dec-2016. It still has some room to continue to appreciate, given the FED’s steady normalization and the maintenance of an accommodative monetary policy in the Eurozone.Overall, the financial system continues to be in good shape, despite the environment of low interest rates. The NPL ratio in the sector is continuing its downward trend begun in 2010. Based on data at the end of the third quarter of 2016 it stands at 2.05%. According to the latest available information for November 2016, lending is growing at a year-on-year rate of 3.2%, with household and commercial loans growing at a similar rate. The behavior of deposits in the system has been more volatile. As of November they increased at 4.9% in year-on-year terms.ActivityAll the comments below on rates of change, for both activity and earnings, will be given at constant exchange rate, unless expressly stated otherwise. These rates, together with changes at current exchange rate, can be seen in the attached tables of financial statements and relevant business indicators.Gross lending to customers in the United States in 2016 continues the moderation which began in the second half of 2015, for two complementary reasons; first, the strategy in the area focused on selective growth in the most profitable portfolios and segments and thus represent a more efficient capital consumption; and second, portfolio sales in the residential mortgage segment, made basically in the second half of 2016. As a result, this heading has fallen by 0.9% over the year. By portfolios, the growth is focused on secured loans and credit cards for the large corporates and the commercial segment.With regard to the asset quality of the portfolio, the NPL ratio at the end of 2016 is 1.5%, an improvement on that reported at 30-Sep-2016 (1.7%). The coverage ratio closed 2016 at 94% (compared with 87% at the close of September). BBVA in the United States maintains a conservative and prudent policy of extending credit and collateral requirements to companies in the energy sector. The exploration &amp;amp; production portfolio accounts for 2.9% of the total BBVA Compass portfolio.Customer deposits under management performed better in the final part of the year (up 1.8% in the fourth quarter), leading to a year-on-year growth of 1.7%. This growth is strongly influenced by the increase in both current and savings accounts (up 1.8% quarterly) and time deposits (up 1.6% in the last three months). In year-on-year terms, current and savings accounts have risen by 4.7%, while time deposits have declined by 7.8%.EarningsThe United States generated a net attributable profit for 2016 of €459m. There was outstanding performance in this area, particularly in the last quarter, when growth was 29.7% compared to the third quarter. As a result the cumulative year-on-year decline slowed to 11.5%. In addition, the most relevant aspects are:The good performance of net interest income has improved further, increasing as a cumulative total by 7.6% year-on-year, due mainly to the rise in interest rates and good management of customer spreads.Income from fees and commissions increased by 3.2% over the year, basically due to the improvement in asset management fees, card and merchant processing fees and money transfers.NTI fell by 23.9% on the previous year as a result of the difficult market situation and lower sales of ALCO portfolios compared with 2015.The rate of increase in operating expenses has moderated to a 1.7% year-on-year.Lastly, impairment losses on financial assets have grown by 55.8%, basically due to an increase in provisions following the impact of the deterioration of the energy sector in the first quarter the year. The amount has steadily declined in the following quarters. The cumulative cost of risk in the area in 2016 is 0.37%, a clear improvement with respect to the peak in the first quarter (0.63%) and compared with the figure for the first nine months of 2016 (0.44%).TurkeyHighlightsStrong lending activity, heavily concentrated on loans in Turkish lira, and growth in deposits.Positive trend in net interest income.Growth in expenses in line with inflation.Risk metrics reflects good management in a complex environment.Business activity(Year-on-year change at constant exchange rate with Turkey in comparable terms.

Inflation rose again in the final part of 2016, reversing the moderate figures posted since half-way through the year, as a result of weak domestic demand. This upward trend will probably continue, boosted by the depreciation of the Turkish lira and higher energy prices.The Central Bank of Turkey (CBRT) increased interest rates slightly in November 2016 and January 2017, interrupting the series of cuts since March 2016 in the upper end of the interest-rate corridor.The Turkish financial sector is maintaining the trend shown in recent quarters. Theyear-on-year rise in lending, adjusted for the effect of the depreciation of the Turkish lira, was 10.4% according to the latest data at the close of 2016, supported by 11% growth in consumer finance. Deposit gathering has maintained its strength along the year, with growth of 12% year-on-year, according to end-of-year data adjusted for the exchange-rate impact. Of particular note is the growth in Turkish lira deposits (up 18% year-on-year), which contrasts with the fall of 4% in foreign-currency deposits. The NPL ratio in the system stands at 3.2%, according to the latest available information at the end of 2016. As regards solvency, the sector continues to enjoy high capitalization ratios, with a capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 15.3% as of November.ActivityBBVA’s stake in Garanti Bank has been 39.9% since the third quarter of 2015, when Garanti was incorporated into the Group’s financial statements by the full integration method. Due to this, the year-on-year rates of change in the earnings of this area have been affected by the change in the scope of consolidation. Therefore, to make comparison against 2015 easier, rates of change are shown taking into account the stake in Garanti on an equivalent basis, i.e. including it as if it were incorporated by the full integration method since January 1, 2015 (hereinafter, “Turkey in comparable terms”).All the comments below on rates of change, for both activity and earnings, will be given at constant exchange rate, unless expressly stated otherwise. These rates, together with the changes at the current exchange rate, can be seen in the attached tables of financial statements and relevant business indicators.The year-on-year growth of gross lending to customers in the area accelerated in the last quarter of the year. As of 31-Dec-2016, it grew 17.1% over the balance at 31-Dec-2015. This boost comes from loans in Turkish lira, which are more profitable and on which the bank has focused. In Garanti Bank they have grown at rates above those in the sector (up 18.3% year-on-year compared with growth of 12.0% in the sector). By segment, all loans have made a positive contribution, particularly business banking loans (which is also performing better than the sector average) and loans to private individuals. Of particular note in the latter type of loans in the area is the better performance in the last quarter of the year of general-purpose loans, basically consumer loans (up 5.2%), which have grown above the rate of mortgage loans (up 3.4%) and closed 2016 with a year-on-year increase of 15.6% compared with 15.2% in mortgage loans. Loans in foreign currency continue their quarterly decline. Garanti Bank closed the year with a year-on year change of –5.2%. It should be noted that this contraction has been partially offset by the increase already mentioned in business banking loans in Turkish lira.With regard to asset quality in the area, the main risk indicators have improved on the previous quarters, also with a better performance than the average in the sector. The NPL ratio has fallen to 2.7% from 2.9% as of 30-Sep-2016 (2.8% at the close of 2015), thanks to the reduction in NPL balances derived from portfolio sales. The coverage ratio stands at 124% (compared with the figure of 125% at the close of September 2016, and 129% as of 31-Dec-2015).Growth in customer deposits under management has also accelerated in the area in the last quarter of the year to 4.6% above the balance as of 30-Sep-2016 (up 14.6% in year-on-year terms), with low-cost transactional items growing above time deposits (up 7.4% versus 3.8% respectively). Over 2016 as a whole, the growth of demand deposits (up 14.5% year-on-year) has been similar to that of time deposits (up 14.6%).Financial statements and relevant business indicatorsMillion euros and percentageIncome statement2016∆%(1)∆%(1.2)2015Net interest income3,404(1.9)10.62,194Net fees and commissions731(4.5)7.8471Net trading income77n.s.n.s.(273)Other income/expenses46(33.2)(24.6)42Gross income4,2577.421.22,434Operating expenses(1,738)(4.4)7.8(1,160)Personnel expenses(889)(0.5)12.1(565)Other administrative expenses (635)(15.4)(4.6)(478)Depreciation(214)23.338.7(118)Operating income2,51917.332.61,273Impairment on financial assets (net)(520)(18.1)(7.8)(422)Provisions (net) and other gains (losses)(93)n.s.n.s.2Income before tax1,90625.842.4853Income tax(390)30.047.3(166)Net income1,51524.841.2687Non-controlling interests(917)24.241.6(316)Net attributable profit59925.640.5371Download tableMajor balance sheet items31-12-16∆%∆%(2)31-12-15Cash and balances with central banks, credit institutions and others11,927(18.4)(4.7)14,608Financial assets13,670(8.9)6.315,006Loans and advances to customers55,6120.817.655,182Tangible assets1,4301.718.71,406Other assets2,229(20.4)(7.1)2,801Total assets/liabilities and equity84,866(4.6)11.389,003Deposits from central banks and credit institutions13,490(19.8)(6.4)16,823Deposits from customers47,2440.116.847,199Debt certificates7,907(0.6)16.07,954Subordinated liabilities----Financial liabilities held for trading1,00919.739.7843Other liabilities12,887(11.3)3.614,521Economic capital allocated2,33040.163.51,663Download tableRelevant business indicators31-12-16∆%∆%(2)31-12-15Loans and advances to customers (gross) (3)57,9410.317.157,768Customer deposits under management (3)42,612(1.8)14.643,393Off-balance sheet funds (4)3,7533.721.03,620Risk-weighted assets70,337(3.9)12.173,207Efficiency ratio (%) 40.8&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;47.7NPL ratio (%)2.7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2.8NPL coverage ratio (%)124&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;129Cost of risk (%)0.87&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.11(1) Variations taking into account the financial statements of Garanti Group calculated by the full integration method since January 1, 2015, without involving a change of the data already published.

The figure for the fourth quarter is 4.2% up on the previous quarter. The following are the key facts that explain the account:Positive trend in net interest income, which in 2016 grew 10.6% year-on-year, due to the positive effects derived from cheaper sources of finance (due to the CBRT monetary policy and lower cost of swaps), and maintenance of customer spreads (via the management of deposit costs), together with a greater volume of activity (mainly from loans denominated in Turkish lira and the increase in the proportion of lower-cost deposits as a proportion of total customer deposits under management).Favorable figures from income from fees and commissions, which increased 7.8% year-on-year. It is worth noting the positive impact of the reduction in the recognized provision for the miles paid to Turkish Airlines, given the lower oil price and the good performance of credit card fees. The above, together with the adequate diversification of these revenues, has offset the negative impacts of the depreciation of the Turkish lira (which has made the fees paid in U.S. dollars more expensive), and the suspension of the collection of account maintenance and administration fees imposed by the Turkish Council of State in January 2016.The last quarter of the year was negative in terms of NTI. This can be mainly explained by the changes in the price of the Turkish lira, leading to losses due to exchange-rate differences, which have not been offset by the rest of the items. Even so, the results for this item amounted to €77m in 2016, which compares very favorably to the negative €303m in 2015. This has been possible thanks to the positive performance of the Global Markets unit, the capital gains from the divestment of ALCO portfolios and the booking in the second quarter of the VISA operation. In addition, it should be noted that in 2015, NTI was affected negatively by the volatility of the wholesale markets.Operating expenses grew 7.8% year-on-year, in line with inflation. Disciplined cost control has partially offset the negative impacts of the depreciation in the Turkish lira on the cost headings denominated in foreign currency, higher costs derived from investments made in the upgrading, modernization and digitalization of traditional channels, as well as the 30% increase in the minimum wage since January 2016. As a result, the area has improved its efficiency ratio to 40.8%, from 47.7% in 2015.Impairment losses on financial assets in 2016 stood at €520m, 7.8% below the figure for 2015. In the fourth quarter, there was a reduction of 62.4%. As a result of the above, the cost of risk in the area has fallen to 0.87% from 1.05% as of 30-Sep-2016 (1.11% in 2015).Finally, provisions (net) and other gains/losses basically include a higher amount due to contingent exposures and commitments, and a capital gain of €8m for the sale of the Moscow subsidiary.MexicoHighlightsActivity continues strong.Operating expenses still growing below gross income.Double-digit year-on-year growth in net attributable profit.Stability in risk indicators, as expected.Business Activity (Year-on-year change at constant exchange rate.Data as of 31-12-2016)Operating income (Million euros at constant exchange rate)(1) At current exchange rate: -2.0%Breakdown of loans and advances to customers (gross) (Percentage as of 31-12-2016)Net interest income/ATA (Percentage.

It also reflects deteriorating exports since the end of 2015, linked to the economic slowdown in the United States. This trend looks set to continue, with exports still showing no clear signs of recovery, despite the support provided by a depreciating peso. Private consumption may be curbed further, with confidence faltering as a result of slower job growth and real wages being kept in check.The Mexican Central Bank (Banxico) has been raising interest rates since the end of 2015 (around 50 basis points in each of the first three quarters and 100 basis points in the final quarter) to 5.75% in December. Banxico’s forthcoming decisions are likely to remain in line with this trend, to counteract upward inflationary pressure and anchor expectations given the depreciation of the Mexican peso against the dollar (down 13.1% year-on-year against the euro in 2016).The Mexican financial system maintains comfortable capital adequacy and asset quality indicators. The capital adequacy ratio has risen slightly to 15.2%, while the NPL ratio is down to 2.3%, according to November figures released by the National Securities Banking Commission (CNBV). Also in November, lending to the private sector grew at a nominal pace of 14.6% year-on-year, similar to that in the rest of the year. All loan portfolios contributed to this good performance. Traditional deposit gathering (demand and time deposits) was up 14.7% year-on-year in nominal terms (November 2016 figures), with similar performance for both components.ActivityAll rates of change given below, for both activity and earnings, will be at constant exchange rate, unless expressly stated otherwise. These rates, together with changes at current exchange rate, can be seen in the attached tables of financial statements and relevant business indicators.According to data at the close of 2016, BBVA in Mexico continues to perform well in lending, which has increased by 12.9% in year-on-year terms. As a result, BBVA Bancomer has retained its leading position, with a market share for its current portfolio of 23.5% (according to local information from the CNBV for the close of November 2016).Year-end figures indicate that the wholesale and retail portfolios are of equal weight, each representing approximately 50% of the total. The wholesale portfolio has increased 16.1%year-on-year. There was a good performance in business loans, including loans to corporate clients and mid-sized companies, which increased by 18.4% over the year and 6.2% in the fourth quarter. Within the loan book, lending to housing developers has been positive for the sixth quarter in a row, with ayear-on-year increase of 34.2% (up 11.6% in the fourth quarter).The retail portfolio has grown by 10.8% since the close of 2015, and 1.9% in the last three months. It is still buoyed by loans to SMEs and consumer finance, which were up 18.7% and 16.5% respectively. Credit cards continued their positive trend of previous quarters. As of 31-Dec-2016, year-on-year growth stood at 6.4%, boosted by new production (up 14.5% year-on-year according to accumulated figures at the close of 2016). Finally, residential mortgage new production also performed well, with a year-on-year increase of 12.8% in the cumulative figure for 2016. The maturity of this portfolio continues to determine growth in its balance, which is less dynamic than for other retail segments (up 6.4% in the last twelve months).With regard to asset quality the main risk indicators are following a pattern of stability, in accordance with expectations. Thus, the NPL and coverage ratios closed the month of December at 2.3% and 127% respectively.Total customer funds (customer deposits under management, mutual funds, pension funds and other off-balance sheet funds) posted year-on-year growth of 8.4% (up 0.4% in the last quarter). All products performed positively: current and savings accounts were up 10.8% in the year, and time deposits grew by 15.2%. Thanks to this trend, BBVA in Mexico can maintain a profitable funding mix in which lower-cost items account for around 80% of total customer deposits under management. Off-balance sheet customer funds saw year-on-year growth ease to 2.0%.EarningsBBVA in Mexico posted a cumulative net attributable profit through December 2016 of €1,980m, with a year-on-year rate of growth of 11.0%, underpinned by:An increase of 11.6% in net interest income, boosted mainly by higher volumes of activity.Good performance of income from fees and commissions, with year-on-year growth of 10.2%, supported by a greater volume of transactions with credit card customers and fees from online banking.Growth in NTI (up 31.8%) thanks to a good performance from the Global Markets unit, above all toward the end of the year.A positive performance in the other income/expenses heading (up 16.0%), primarily thanks good revenue from insurance activities, and supported by the booking of the reserves released by changes in estimates affecting the system of calculation.Increase in operating expenses (up 7.2%) below the growth of gross income in the area (up 12.1%) and also below the cumulative figure through the third quarter of 2016 (up 7.9%). This helped to improve the efficiency ratio, which in 2016 stood at 35.4% (compared with 37.0% in 2015). The indicator is well below the sector average not including BBVA Bancomer (56.4% according to local information from the CNBV for the close of November 2016).Impairment losses on financial assets up year-on-year by 16.8%. As a result, the cumulative cost of risk for the area stands at 3,40%, below the year-end forecast of 3,50%.Lastly, provisions (net) and other gains (losses) includes restructuring costs associated to the Group’s transformation process, which aims to forge a simpler, closer and more efficient organization. As a result, this heading grew a cumulative 47.4% year-on-year.South AmericaHighlightsGrowth in lending activity in the region slows, in line with moderation in the macroeconomic environment.Good performance of customer deposits.Positive trend in revenues.Costs influenced by high inflation in some countries and the adverse effect of exchange rates.Credit risk metrics behavior as expected: slight deterioration due to macro environment.Business Activity (Year-on-year change at constant exchange rate.Data as of 31-12-2016)Operating income (Million euros at constant exchange rate)(1) At current exchange rates: -13.5%Breakdown of loans and advances to customers - gross (Percentage as of 31-12-2016)Net interest income/ATA (Percentage.

However, expectations are now more upbeat, boosted by recovering oil and commodity prices. This is reflected in sustained capital inflows, fueled by investors seeking profitability and low levels of volatility.Given the weak activity and moderate inflation, most central banks (with the exception of Colombia) are adopting more accommodative monetary policies. While exchange rates for the Argentine peso and the Venezuelan bolivar depreciated against the euro in 2016, the Chilean and Colombian pesos and the Peruvian sol have all gained. The FED’s monetary normalization may lead to future depreciation, but it is likely to be far more moderate than in 2015.As regards the financial systems within BBVA’s regional footprint, key profitability and capital adequacy indicators are high, while NPL ratios remain in check in aggregate terms (with some differences between the countries). In addition, there has been sustained growth in lending and deposits.ActivityUnless expressly stated otherwise, all the comments below on rates of change, for both activity and earnings, are expressed at constant exchange rates. These rates, together with changes at current exchange rates, can be seen in the attached tables of financial statements and relevant business indicators.Gross lending to customers closed 2016 with quarter-on-quarter growth of 3.6% and yearon-year growth of 7.9%. All countries reported growth, spearheaded by Argentina (up 33.5%), Colombia (up 8.3%) and Chile (up 5.1%). By products, there was a standout performance from the retail portfolios, particularly credit cards (up 17.9%), consumer finance (up 10.8%) and residential mortgages (up 8.3%).As regards asset quality, the macroeconomic situation continues to influence the NPL and coverage ratios, which closed the year at 2.9% and 103% respectively.Customer funds closed the year at a yearon-year growth of 14.2%, with a positive contribution from all products and geographic areas. By product, the best performance was in off-balance sheet funds (up 18.2%) and term deposits (up 16.3%), while by country there was significant growth in Argentina (up 57.0%) and Colombia (up 14.1%).Financial statements and relevant business indicatorsMillion euros and percentageIncome statement2016∆%∆% (1) 2015Net interest income2,930(8.5)11.43,202Net fees and commissions634(11.6)8.2718Net trading income464(22.0)9.7595Other income/expenses25n.s.(30.7)(38)Gross income4,054(9.5)10.34,477Operating expenses(1,894)(4.3)17.5(1,979)Operating expenses(982)(3.8)17.7(1,022)Other administrative expenses (811)(5.0)17.0(853)Depreciation(100)(3.3)19.0(104)Operating income2,160(13.5)4.72,498Impairment on financial assets (net)(526)(14.2)(2.9)(614)Provisions (net) and other gains (losses)(82)15.2163.9(71)Income before tax1,552(14.4)4.11,814Income tax(487)(13.8)13.8(565)Net income1,065(14.7)0.21,248Non-controlling interests(294)(14.2)(2.1)(343)Net attributable profit771(14.9)1.1905Download tableMillion euros and percentageMajor balance sheet items31-12-16∆%∆% (1) 31-12-15Cash and balances with central banks, credit institutions and others15,9255.26.115,135Financial assets10,73912.39.19,561Loans and advances to customers48,71811.77.743,596Tangible assets80712.418.5718Other assets1,7294.73.61,652Total assets/liabilities and equity77,91810.37.670,661Deposits from central banks and credit institutions6,656(17.5)(22.4)8,070Deposits from customers47,92113.511.942,227Debt certificates5,64317.49.64,806Subordinated liabilities1,8504.8(2.6)1,765Financial liabilities held for trading2,585(22.6)(28.5)3,342Other liabilities10,56135.036.27,825Economic capital allocated2,7032.94.52,626Download tableMillion euros and percentageRelevant business indicators31-12-16∆%∆% (1) 31-12-15Loans and advances to customers (gross) (2)50,31611.97.944,970Customer deposits under management (2)48,33415.013.342,032Off-balance sheet funds (3) 11,90222.318.29,729Risk-weighted assets57,3941.50.556,563Efficiency ratio (%) 46.7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;44.2NPL ratio (%)2.9&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2.3NPL coverage ratio (%)103&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;123Cost of risk (%)1.15&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.26Download table(1) Figures at constant exchange rates.

The most relevant aspects of the income statement over the last twelve months in the area are as follows:Gross income grew by 10.3%, thanks to the high capacity to generate revenues in the area, boosted chiefly by increased activity. Net interest income is up 11.4% and fees and commissions have grown by 8.2%. NTI also performed very well (up 9.7%), influenced by the lifting of the “exchange clamp” in Argentina and the sale of holdings in Colombia. Finally, in the other income/expenses heading, insurance activities performed well, with net earnings in the region rising by 17.6%. The increase was driven by good figures from both net claims and premiums, mainly in the non-life segment.The increase in operating expenses slowed compared with previous quarters, to a year-on-year growth of 17.5%. High inflation in some of the countries in the region and changes in the exchange rate against the dollar have had a negative impact on items denominated in the U.S. currency, and were largely responsible for the year-on-year increase of this heading.Impairment losses on financial assets fell by 2.9%, putting the cumulative cost of risk in 2016 at 1.15% (1.13% in September 2016 and 1.26% in 2015).Finally, the provisions (net) and other gains (losses) heading chiefly includes restructuring costs associated to the Group’s transformation process.By country, Argentina has performed well in all its margins thanks to strong activity, thus offsetting expenses linked to inflation. Earnings in Chile have been affected by higher loanloss provisions than in the 2015. In Colombia the positive performance of gross income has been boosted by good income from fees and commissions and NTI, and good figures from impairment losses on financial assets. In Peru, net interest income and income from fees and commissions grew at a higher rate than activity, which was affected by slower growth in NTI and higher loan-loss provisions.South America.

However, some events at the end of the year (the constitutional referendum in Italy) and the beginning of 2017 (start of the Brexit negotiations) make it difficult to think that growth will pick up over the coming quarters. The domestic support for growth is still in place and economic policies continue to foster recovery. Fiscal policy in 2017 will be somewhat less expansive in the area as a whole than in 2016, while the European Central Bank (ECB) continues with its commitment to maintain a very expansive monetary policy until there are clear indications that the movement of inflation toward its target is clearly sustainable.In China growth stabilized at a year-on-year 6.7% in the third quarter of the year, supported by solid consumption and increased credit, thanks to monetary expansion and, above all, fiscal measures. These measures have led to a slight increase in total investment, although private investment continues to slow, suggesting the deleveraging process in the private sector is still underway. This outlook and the recent increase in housing prices will lead the Central Bank to delay interest-rate cuts until 2017, at least until it can see how effective the macroprudential measures implemented are. Thus doubts about a significant slowdown in the economy have been eased.Financial statements and relevant business indicatorsMillion euros and percentageIncome statement2016∆%2015Net interest income166(9.7)183Net fees and commissions19413.8170Net trading income87(30.3)125Other income/expenses45n.s.(6)Gross income4914.0473Operating expenses(342)(2.7)(352)Personnel expenses(181)(6.9)(194)Other administrative expenses (149)4.6(143)Depreciation(12)(18.7)(15)Operating income14923.6121Impairment on financial assets (net)30n.s.(4)Provisions (net) and other gains (losses)23n.s.(6)Income before tax20383.2111Income tax(52)47.0(35)Net income151100.175Non-controlling interests0-0Net attributable profit151100.175Download tableMajor balance sheet items31-12-16∆%31-12-15Cash and balances with central banks, credit institutions and others1,587(13.3)1,829Financial assets1,787(4.4)1,868Loans and advances to customers15,199(2.4)15,579Inter-area positions--3,790Tangible assets38(9.2)42Other assets3692.5360Total assets/liabilities and equity18,980(19.1)23,469Deposits from central banks and credit institutions2,670(50.2)5,364Deposits from customers12,796(15.0)15,053Debt certificates---Subordinated liabilities315(0.7)317Inter-area positions1,296n.s.-Financial liabilities held for trading67(21.0)85Other liabilities577(58.3)1,381Economic capital allocated1,259(0.7)1,269Download tableFinancial statements and relevant business indicatorsRelevant business indicators31-12-16∆%31-12-15Loans and advances to customers (gross) (1)15,709(2.7)16,143Customer deposits under management (1) 12,723(14.9)14,959Off-balance sheet funds (2)36610.5331Risk-weighted assets15,196(1.0)15,356Efficiency ratio (%) 69.6&amp;nbsp;74.4NPL ratio (%)2.7&amp;nbsp;2.5NPL coverage ratio (%)84&amp;nbsp;96Cost of risk (%)(0.22)&amp;nbsp;0.02Download table(1) Excluding repos.

It has grown by 5.7% in the last three months of the year, strongly supported by the positive trend recorded in Asia (up 20.3%) and to a lesser extent in the rest of Europe (up 2.5%). However, the figure for the last twelve months declined by 2.7%, due to the bad performance in Asia in the first three quarters of 2016.With regard to the main credit risk indicators, and despite a slight deterioration against the close of 2015, they are maintained at very limited levels (NPL ratio at 2.7% and coverage at 84%).Total customer funds (customer deposits under management and pension funds) closed 2016 at 14.4% below the figure at the end of 2015. In this case, the fall can be explained by a decline in the branches in Europe (down 24.6%).With respect to earnings, gross income increased significantly in the fourth quarter of the year (up 39.2%), thanks to increased earnings in all the CIB business lines. This has offset the decline of the cumulative figure in the area, with the result that this heading increased in 2016 by 4.0% compared with the figure for 2015. The year has been positive in terms of the performance of the earnings distribution procedure, income from fees and commissions, and the payment of the CNCB dividend (which was not received in the second quarter of 2015). The above has been offset by lower net interest income, impacted by macroeconomic reality in the Eurozone, with negative interest rates that have led to fewer transactions, and a negative performance of NTI (although they posted a significant advance of 82.0% in the fourth quarter). Operating expenses continue to slow, with a year-on-year decline of 2.7%. Of note has been a significant improvement in personnel expenses (down 6.9%), impairment losses on financial assets, and provisions (net) and other gains (losses). Overall, Eurasia has contributed a net attributable profit of €151m in 2016, double the 2015 figure with ayear-on-year increase of 100.1%.Corporate CenterThe most significant aspects of the Corporate Center’s income statement for 2016 are as follows:Greater contribution from NTI compared with 2015, mainly as a result of the capital gains registered from the partial sales on the market of BBVA Group’s stake in CNCB.The other income/expenses heading basically includes the dividends from Telefónica (paid in the second and fourth quarters).Year-on-year increase of 3.7%, in operating expenses, due to higher depreciation charges. Personnel costs have only increased by 0.3%.Lack of corporate operations. The results from corporate operations in 2015, a loss of €1.109m, included: €705m in capital gains after tax from the various sale operations equivalent to 6.34% of BBVA Group’s stake in CNCB (€583m in the first quarter from the sale of 5.6% and €122m in the second quarter from the sale of 0.8%); €26m (also after tax) from the badwill generated by the CX deal; a negative €1.840m from the valuation at fair value of the initial 25.01% stake held by BBVA in Garanti (third quarter), following the acquisition of an additional 14.89% stake in the Turkish entity; and the practically neutral impact of the sale of the 29.68% stake in CIFH (third quarter).Overall, the Corporate Center posted a negative cumulative result of €801m, which compares with a loss of €1.910m in 2015 (–€800m excluding corporate operations).Financial statementsMillion eurosIncome statement2016∆%2015Net interest income(461)8.7(424)Net fees and commissions(133)32.3(100)Net trading income356120.6161Other income/expenses1783.7172Gross income(60)(68.7)(192)Operating expenses(856)3.7(826)Personnel expenses(472)0.3(471)Other administrative expenses (69)(41.8)(118)Depreciation(315)33.1(237)Operating income(916)(10.0)(1,017)Impairment on financial assets (net)(37)178.8(13)Provisions (net) and other gains (losses)(140)(10.4)(157)Income before tax(1,094)(7.9)(1,187)Income tax296(27.2)407Net income from ongoing operations(798)2.2(781)Results from corporate operations (1)0(100.0)(1,109)Net income(798)(57.8)(1,890)Non-controlling interests(3)(83.9)(19)Net attributable profit(801)(58.1)(1,910)Net attributable profit excluding corporate operations(801)0.1(800)Download table(1) 2015 includes the capital gains from the various sale operations equivalent to 6.34% of BBVA Group’s stake in CNCB, the badwill from the CX operation, the effect of the valuation at fair value of the 25,01% initial stake held by BBVA in Garanti and the impact of the sale of BBVA’s 29.68% stake in CIFH.Major balance sheet items31-12-16∆%31-12-15Cash and balances with central banks, credit institutions and others(2)n.s.2Financial assets1,675(41.9)2,886Loans and advances to customers1509.9137Inter-area positions---Tangible assets2,671(6.7)2,864Other assets19,017(15.0)22,370Total assets/liabilities and equity23,512(16.8)28,258Deposits from central banks and credit institutions---Deposits from customers---Debt certificates4,855(17.1)5,857Subordinated liabilities5,57020.14,636Inter-area positions(13,696)40.4(9,755)Financial liabilities held for trading---Other liabilities2,705(46.1)5,021Economic capital allocated50,8033.049,315Capital y reservas(26,726)(0.3)(26,814)Download table",

Significant influence is deemed to exist when the Group owns 20% or more of the voting rights of an investee directly or indirectly.Available-for-sale financial assets: Available-for-sale (AFS) financial assets are debt securities that are not classified as held-tomaturity investments or as financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) and equity instruments that are not subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities and have not been designated as at FVTPL.Basic earnings per share: Calculated by dividing “Profit attributable to Parent Company” corresponding to ordinary shareholders of the entity by the weighted average number of shares outstanding throughout the year (i.e., excluding the average number of treasury shares held over the year).Basis risk: Risk arising from hedging exposure to one interest rate with exposure to a rate that reprices under slightly different conditions.Business combination: A business combination is a transaction, or any other event, through which a single entity obtains the control of one or more businesses.Cash flow hedges: Those that hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction and could affect profit or loss.Commissions: Income and expenses relating to commissions and similar fees are recognized in the consolidated income statement using criteria that vary according to their nature. The most significant income and expense items in this connection are:Fees and commissions relating linked to financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, which are recognized when collectedFees and commissions arising from transactions or services that are provided over a period of time, which are recognized over the life of these transactions or services.Fees and commissions generated by a single act are accrued upon execution of that act.Consolidated statements of cash flows: The indirect method has been used for the preparation of the consolidated statement of cash flows. This method starts from the entity’s consolidated profit and adjusts its amount for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments, and items of income or expense associated with cash flows classified as investment or finance. As well as cash, shortterm, highly liquid investments subject to a low risk of changes in value, such as cash and deposits in central banks, are classified as cash and equivalents. When preparing these financial statements the following definitions have been used:Cash flows: Inflows and outflows of cash and equivalents.Operating activities: The typical activities of credit institutions and other activities that cannot be classified as investment or financing activities.Investing activities: The acquisition, sale or other disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash and cash equivalents or in operating activities.Financing activities: Activities that result in changes in the size and composition of the Group’s equity and of liabilities that do not form part of operating activities.Consolidated statements of changes in equity: The consolidated statements of changes in equity reflect all the movements generated in each year in each of the headings of the consolidated equity, including those from transactions undertaken with shareholders when they act as such, and those due to changes in accounting criteria or corrections of errors, if any. The applicable regulations establish that certain categories of assets and liabilities are recognized at their fair value with a charge to equity. These charges, known as “Valuation adjustments” (see Note 31), are included in the Group’s total consolidated equity net of tax effect, which has been recognized as deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate.Consolidated statements of recognized income and expenses: The consolidated statements of recognized income and expenses reflect the income and expenses generated each year. Such statement distinguishes between income and expenses recognized in the consolidated income statements and “Other recognized income (expenses)” recognized directly in consolidated equity. “Other recognized income (expenses)” include the changes that have taken place in the year in the “Valuation adjustments” broken down by item.The sum of the changes to the heading “Other comprehensive income ” of the consolidated total equity and the consolidated profit for the year comprise the “Total recognized income/expenses of the year”.Contingencies: Current obligations of the entity arising as a result of past events whose existence depends on the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events independent of the will of the entity.Contingentcommitments: Possible obligations of the entity that arise from past events and whose existence depends on the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events independent of the entity’s will and that could lead to the recognition of financial assets.Control: An investor controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. An investor controls an investee if and only if the investor has all the following:a) Power; An investor has power over an investee when the investor has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities, i.e. the activities that significantly affect the investee’s returns.b) Returns; An investor is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee when the investor’s returns from its involvement have the potential to vary as a result of the investee’s performance. The investor’s returns can be only positive, only negative or both positive and negative.c) Link between power and returns; An investor controls an investee if the investor not only has power over the investee and exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, but also has the ability to use its power to affect the investor’s returns from its involvement with the investee.Correlation risk: Correlation risk is related to derivatives whose final value depends on the performance of more than one underlying asset (primarily, stock baskets) and indicates the existing variability in the correlations between each pair of assets.Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA): An adjustment to the valuation of OTC derivative contracts to reflect the creditworthiness of OTC derivative counterparties.Current service cost: Current service cost is the increase in the present value of a defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current period.

The assets and liabilities of the Group entities are incorporated line-by-line on the consolidate balance sheets, after conciliation and the elimination in full of intragroup balances, including amounts payable and receivable. Group entity income statement income and expense headings are similarly combined line by line into the consolidated income statement, having made the following consolidation eliminations:a) income and expenses in respect of intragroup transactions are eliminated in full. b) profits and losses resulting from intragroup transactions are similarly eliminated. The carrying amount of the parent’s investment and the parent’s share of equity in each subsidiary are eliminated.Goodwill: Goodwill acquired in a business combination represents a payment made by the acquirer in anticipation of future economic benefits from assets that are not able to be individually identified and separately recognized.Hedges of net investments in foreign operations: Foreign currency hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.Held for trading (assets and liabilities): Financial assets and liabilities acquired or incurred primarily for the purpose of profiting from variations in their prices in the short term. This category also includes financial derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting, and in the case of borrowed securities, financial liabilities originated by the firm sale of financial assets acquired under repurchase agreements or received on loan (“short positions”).Held-to-maturity investments: Held-to-maturity investments are financial assets traded on an active market, with fixed maturity and fixed or determinable payments and cash flows that an entity has the positive intention and financial ability to hold to maturity.Impaired financial assets: A financial asset is deemed impaired, and accordingly restated to fair value, when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that give rise to:a) A measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows since the initial recognition of those assets in the case of debt instruments (loans and receivables and debt securities).b) A significant or prolonged drop in fair value below cost in the case of equity instruments.Income from equity instruments: Dividends and income on equity instruments collected or announced during the year corresponding to profits generated by investees after the ownership interest is acquired.

It might be acceptable to designate only some of a number of similar financial assets or financial liabilities if doing so a significant reduction (and possibly a greater reduction than other allowable designations) in the inconsistency is achieved.b) The performance of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities is managed and evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, and information about the group is provided internally on that basis to the entity´s key management personnel. These are financial assets managed jointly with “Liabilities under insurance contracts” measured at fair value, in combination with derivatives written with a view to significantly mitigating exposure to changes in these contracts’ fair value, or in combination with financial liabilities and derivatives designed to significantly reduce global exposure to interest rate risk. These headings include customer loans and deposits effected via so-called unit-linked life insurance contracts, in which the policyholder assumes the investment risk.ther Reserves: This heading is broken down as follows:i) Reserves or accumulated losses of investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associate: include the accumulated amount of income and expenses generated by the aforementioned investments through profit or loss in past years.ii) Other: includes reserves different from those separately disclosed in other items and may include legal reserve and statutory reserve.Other retributions to employees long term: Includes the amount of compensation plans to employees long termOwn/treasury shares: The amount of own equity instruments held by the entity.Past service cost:* It is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for employee service in prior periods, resulting in the current period from the introduction of, or changes to, post-employment benefits or other long-term employee benefits.Post-employment benefits: Retirement benefit plans are arrangements whereby an enterprise provides benefits for its employees on or after termination of service.Potential problem risk: All debt instruments and contingent risks which do not meet the criteria to be classified individually as non-performing or written-off, but show weaknesses that may entail for the entity the need to assume losses greater than the hedges for impairment of risks subject to special monitoring.Probability of default (PD): It is the probability of the counterparty failing to meet its principal and/or interest payment obligations. The PD is associated with the rating/scoring of each counterparty/transaction.Property, plant and equipment/tangible assets: Buildings, land, fixtures, vehicles, computer equipment and other facilities owned by the entity or acquired under finance leases.Provisions: Provisions include amounts recognized to cover the Group’s current obligations arising as a result of past events, certain in terms of nature but uncertain in terms of amount and/or cancellation date.Provisions for contingent liabilities and commitments: Provisions recorded to cover exposures arising as a result of transactions through which the entity guarantees commitments assumed by third parties in respect of financial guarantees granted or other types of contracts, and provisions for contingent commitments, i.e., irrevocable commitments which may arise upon recognition of financial assets.Provisions for pensions and similar obligation: Constitutes all provisions recognized to cover retirement benefits, including commitments assumed vis-à-vis beneficiaries of early retirement and analogous schemes.Provisions or (-) reversal of provisions: Provisions recognized during the year, net of recoveries on amounts provisioned in prior years, with the exception of provisions for pensions and contributions to pension funds which constitute current or interest expense.Refinanced Operation: An operation which is totally or partially brought up to date with its payments as a result of a refinancing operation made by the entity itself or by another company in its group.Refinancing Operation: An operation which, irrespective of the holder or guarantees involved, is granted or used for financial or legal reasons related to current or foreseeable financial difficulties that the holder(s) may have in settling one or more operations granted by the entity itself or by other companies in its group to the holder(s) or to another company or companies of its group, or through which such operations are totally or partially brought up to date with their payments, in order to enable the holders of the settled or refinanced operations to pay off their loans (principal and interest) because they are unable, or are expected to be unable, to meet the conditions in a timely and appropriate manner.Renegotiated Operation: An operation whose financial conditions are modified when the borrower is not experiencing financial difficulties, and is not expected to experience them in the future, i.e. the conditions are modified for reasons other than restructuring.Repricing risk: Risks related to the timing mismatch in the maturity and repricing of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet short and long-term positions.Restructured Operation: An operation whose financial conditions are modified for economic or legal reasons related to the holder’s (or holders’) current or foreseeable financial difficulties, in order to enable payment of the loan (principal and interest), because the holder is unable, or is expected to be unable, to meet those conditions in a timely and appropriate manner, even if such modification is provided for in the contract. In any event, the following are considered restructured operations: operations in which a haircut is made or assets are received in order to reduce the loan, or in which their conditions are modified in order to extend their maturity, change the amortization table in order to reduce the amount of the installments in the short term or reduce their frequency, or to establish or extend the grace period for the principal, the interest or both; except when it can be proved that the conditions are modified for reasons other than the financial difficulties of the holders and, are similar to those applied on the market on the modification date for operations granted to customers with a similar risk profile.Retained earnings: Accumulated net profits or losses recognized in the income statement in prior years and retained in equity upon distribution.Securitization fund: A fund that is configured as a separate equity and administered by a management company. An entity that would like funding sells certain assets to the securitization fund, which, in turn, issues securities backed by said assets.Share premium: The amount paid in by owners for issued equity at a premium to the shares’ nominal value.Shareholders’ funds: Contributions by stockholders, accumulated earnings recognized in the income statement and the equity components of compound financial instruments.Short positions: Financial liabilities arising as a result of the final sale of financial assets acquired under repurchase agreements or received on loan.Significant influence: Is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control of those policies. If an entity holds, directly or indirectly (i.e. through subsidiaries), 20 per cent or more of the voting power of the investee, it is presumed that the entity has significant influence, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case. Conversely, if the entity holds, directly or indirectly (i.e. through subsidiaries), less than 20 per cent of the voting power of the investee, it is presumed that the entity does not have significant influence, unless such influence can be clearly demonstrated. A substantial or majority ownership by another investor does not necessarily preclude an entity from having significant influence. The existence of significant influence by an entity is usually evidenced in one or more of the following ways:a) representation on the board of directors or equivalent governing body of the investee;b)participation in policy-making processes, including participation in decisions about dividends or other distributions;c) material transactions between the entity and its investee;d) interchange of managerial personnel; or e) provision of essential technical information.Structured credit products: Special financial instrument backed by other instruments building a subordination structure.Structured Entities: A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements. A structured entity often has some or all of the following features or attributes:a) restricted activities.b) a narrow and well-defined objective, such as to effect a tax-efficient lease, carry out research and development activities, provide a source of capital or funding to an entity or provide investment opportunities for investors y passing on risks and rewards associated with the assets of the structured entity to investors.c) insufficient equity to permit the structured entity to finance its activities without subordinated financial support.d)financing in the form of multiple contractually linked instruments to investors that create concentrations of credit or other risks (tranches).Subordinated liabilities: Financing received, regardless of its instrumentation, which ranks after the common creditors in the event of a liquidation.Subsidiaries: Companies over which the Group exercises control. An entity is presumed to have control over another when it possesses the right to oversee its financial and operational policies, through a legal, statutory or contractual procedure, in order to obtain benefits from its economic activities. Control is presumed to exist when the parent owns, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, more than one half of an entity’s voting power, unless, exceptionally, it can be clearly demonstrated that ownership of more than one half of an entity’s voting rights does not constitute control of it. Control also exists when the parent owns half or less of the voting power of an entity when there is:a) an agreement that gives the parent the right to control the votes of other shareholders;b) power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity under a statute or an agreement; power to appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board of directors or equivalent governing body and control of the entity is by that board or body;c) power to cast the majority of votes at meetings of the board of directors or equivalent governing body and control of the entity is by that board or body.Tax liabilities: All tax related liabilities except for provisions for taxes.Territorials bonds: Financial assets or fixed asset security issued with the guarantee of portfolio loans of the public sector of the issuing entityTier 1 Capital: Includes: Common stock, parent company reserves, reserves in consolidated companies, non-controlling interests, deduction and others and attributed net incomeTier 2 Capital: Includes: Subordinated, preferred shares, generic countable and non- controlling interestUnit-link: This is life insurance in which the policyholder assumes the risk. In these policies, the funds for the technical insurance provisions are invested in the name of and on behalf of the policyholder in shares of Collective Investment Institutions and other financial assets chosen by the policyholder, who bears the investment risk.Value at Risk (VaR): Value at Risk (VaR) is the basic variable for measuring and controlling the Group’s market risk. This risk metric estimates the maximum loss that may occur in a portfolio’s market positions for a particular time horizon and given confidence level.VaR figures are estimated following two methodologies:‘VaR without smoothing, which awards equal weight to the daily information for the immediately preceding last two years. This is currently the official methodology for measuring market risks vis-à-vis limits compliance of the risk.VaR with smoothing, which weights more recent market information more heavily. This is a metric which supplements the previous one.VaR with smoothing adapts itself more swiftly to the changes in financial market conditions, whereas VaR without smoothing is, in general, a more stable metric that will tend to exceed VaR with smoothing when the markets show less volatile trends, while it will tend to be lower when they present upturns in uncertainty.Yield curve risk: Risks arising from changes in the slope and the shape of the yield curve.",

At the close of December 2016, the fully-loaded CET1 ratio stood at 10.9%, thanks to the generation of recurring earnings for the Group in a highly volatile market environment and the control on growth of risk-weighted assets (RWA).The fully-loaded leverage ratio closed at 6.5%, which compares very favorably with the rest of the peer group.BBVA Share (Euros)Risk managementThe improvement in the main asset quality indicators continues: As of 31-Dec2016, the NPL ratio and cumulative cost of risk have declined and the coverage ratio has fallen slightly compared to data at the end of 2015.Net attibutable profit breakdown (1) (Percentage 2016)(1) Excludes the Corporate CenterThe BBVA shareA cash dividend of €0,08 per share was paid in January 2017.Other matters of interestThe Group’s digital and mobile customer base continues to increase (up 20% and 38% year-on-year, respectively).ResultsBBVA Group’s earnings for 2016 are affected by:Changes in the scope of consolidation in the second and third quarters of 2015 (CX and Garanti, respectively).The negative impact of year-on-year changes in average exchange rates against the euro of the main currencies that have an influence on the Entity’s financial statements (except for the U.S. dollar).Lack of corporate operations.In order to make the year-on-year comparison easier, the end of this section includes an income statement with rates of change that take into account Turkey in comparable terms; i.e. including BBVA’s stake in Garanti as if it had been incorporated by the full integration method since January 1, 2015.BBVA Group generated a net attributable profit of €3.475m in 2016. The most relevant aspects of the year-on-year changes in the income statement are:Positive performance of revenues.Limited growth of operating expenses, which have grown below the rate of increase in gross income, thus improving the efficiency ratio.Reduction in impairment losses on financial assets.Consolidated income statement: quarterly evolution (1)(Million euros)Million of euros201620154Q3Q2Q1Q4Q3Q2Q1QNet interest income4,3854,3104,2134,1524,4154,4903,8583,663Net fees and commissions1,1611,2071,1891,1611,2631,2251,1401,077Net trading income379577819357451133650775Dividend income13135257451275219442Share of profit or loss of entities accounted for using the equity method717(6)7(16)3183Other operating income and expenses15952(26)66(94)766273Gross income6,2226,1986,4455,7886,1465,9805,9225,632Operating expenses (3,243)(3,216)(3,159)(3,174)(3,292)(3,307)(2,942)(2,776)Personnel expenses(1,698)(1,700)(1,655)(1,669)(1,685)(1,695)(1,538)(1,460)Other administrative expenses(1,180)(1,144)(1,158)(1,161)(1,268)(1,252)(1,106)(1,024)Depreciation(365)(372)(345)(344)(340)(360)(299)(291)Operating income2,9802,9823,2872,6142,8532,6732,9802,857Impairment on financial assets (net)(687)(1,004)(1,077)(1,033)(1,057)(1,074)(1,089)(1,119)Provisions (net)(723)(201)(81)(181)(157)(182)(164)(230)Other gains (losses) (284)(61)(75)(62)(97)(127)(123)(66)Income before tax1,2851,7162,0531,3381,5441,2891,6041,442Income tax(314)(465)(557)(362)(332)(294)(429)(386)Net income from ongoing operations 9711,2511,4969761,2129951,1751,056Results from corporate operations (2) ----4(1,840)144583Net income9711,2511,4969761,215(845)1,3191,639Non-controlling interests(293)(286)(373)(266)(275)(212)(97)(103)Net attributable profit6789651,123709940(1,057)1,2231,536Attributable profit without corporate transactions6789651,1237099367841,078953Earning per share (euros) (3) 0.090.140.160.100.13(0.17)0.180.23Earning per share (excluding corporate operations; euros) (3) 0.090.140.160.100.130.110.150.14Download table(1) From the third quarter of 2015, BBVA’s total stake in Garanti is consolidated by the full integration method.

For previous periods, Garanti’s revenues and costs are integrated in the proportion corresponding to the percentage of the Group’s stake then (25,01%).(2) 2015 includes the capital gains from the various sale operations equivalent to 6.34% of BBVA Group’s stake in CNCB, the badwill from the CX operation, the effect of the valuation at fair value of the 25,01% initial stake held by BBVA in Garanti and the impact of the sale of BBVA’s 29.68% stake in CIFH.(3) Adjusted by additional Tier I instrument remuneration.Increase in allocation to provisions, strongly affected by the booking of the provisions covering the contingency of possible future claims by customers as a result of the judgment of the CJEU on “mortgage floor clauses” in loans with consumers.Reduction in other gains (losses), mainly as a result of increased provisioning requirements for properties.Unless expressly indicated otherwise, to better understand the changes in the main headings of the Group’s income statement, the year-on-year percentage changes given below refer to constant exchange rates.Gross incomeThe Group’s cumulative gross income was €24.653m, 14.2% more than in 2015 (up 7.7% with Turkey in comparable terms). More recurring revenues performed outstandingly, in particular net interest income, and earnings from the Group’s insurance activity in practically all the geographical areas.Gross income (Million euros)(1) At constant exchange rates +14.2%Net interest income continues to grow. It rose by 3.9% in the fourth quarter, giving a cumulative increase of 14.9% from the previous year (up 7.0% with Turkey in comparable terms).This positive trend is once more explained by growth in activity, mainly in emerging economies, and maintenance of customer spreads. By business areas there has been a positive performance in Mexico (up 11.6%), South America (up 11.4%), Turkey (up 10.6%) and the United States (up 7.6%). In Spain and the rest of Eurasia net interest income declined as a result of the current very low interest-rate environment, which has led to narrowed spreads and lower business volumes (reduction of lending in both geographic areas and of customer deposits under management in Eurasia).Net interest income/ATA (Percentage)Income from fees and commissions declined in the fourth quarter (down 2.6%), linked closely to market trends and reduced activity in securities and investment banking. However, they have grown in the cumulative figure by 8.5% year-on-year (up 2.5% with Turkey in comparable terms), strongly supported by the good performance of the United States, Turkey, Mexico, South America and Eurasia.As a result, more recurring revenues (net interest income plus income from fees and commissions) in 2016 has increased year-on-year by 13.4%, or 6.0% with Turkey in comparable terms.Net interest income plus fees and comissions (Millioneuros)The contribution from NTI in the fourth quarter is down on the figure for the third, due mainly to unfavorable exchange rates against the euro and dollar (above all of the Turkish lira and Mexican peso), leading to foreign exchange losses that have not been offset by the rest of the items. In the cumulative figure for 2016 there has been a year-on-year increase of 16.2% (up 19.8% with Turkey in comparable terms), due basically to: the capital gains from the VISA Europe operation in the second quarter (On June 21, 2016, VISA Inc. completed the acquisition process of VISA Europe Ltd. This transaction has meant the recognition of a capital gain before tax and minority interests of €225m.), the partial sale on the market of shares held by BBVA Group in CNCB and the good performance of Global Markets, particularly towards the latter part of the year.The dividend income heading mainly includes dividends from the Group’s stakes in Telefónica and CNCB. The 2016 figure is 13.5% higher than in 2015, strongly influenced by the payment in the second quarter of the CNCB dividend (which was not booked in 2015).Finally, other operating income and expenses have increased by 86.5% (up 63.8% with Turkey in comparable terms), strongly influenced by positive income from insurance activities. In fact, the net contribution of the insurance business has increased by 15.7% year-on-year (up 13.4% with Turkey in comparable terms), due to its good performance in all geographical areas and the positive effect in Mexico of the change in the insurance industry regulations affecting the calculation of the mathematical reserves.Operating incomeThere has been a further slowdown in the year-on-year increase in operating expenses, which in the cumulative figure through December 2016 rose by 11.9% (up 6.6% with Turkey in comparable terms), despite the inclusion of expenses associated with the integration of CX for the whole year (in 2015 they were included from April 24), the high level of inflation in some geographical areas where BBVA operates, and the negative effect that currency depreciation has had on cost items denominated in dollars and euros.Operating expenses (Million euros)(1) At constant exchange +11.9%Breakdown of operating expenses and efficiency calculation (million euros)Million euros2016∆%2015 Personnel expenses6,7225.46,377 Wages and salaries5,2674.45,047 Employee welfare expenses93813.5827 Training expenses and other5162.4504 Other administrative expenses4,644(0.1)4,650 Premises1,0802.41,054 IT9689.9880 Communications2941.9289 Advertising and publicity3981.4393 Corporate expenses104(8.4)114 Other expenses1,367(5.3)1,444 Levies and taxes433(9.1)476Administration expenses11,3663.111,027 Depreciation1,42610.51,290Operating expenses 12,7913.912,317Gross income24,6534.123,680Efficiency ratio (operating expenses/gross income; %)51.9&amp;nbsp;52.0Download tableThe Group’s effort to reduce costs has led to expenses increasing at a lower rate than gross income. Thus there was a slight improvement in the efficiency ratio, which closed the year at 51.9% (52.0% in 2015). Operating income increased by 16.9% (up 8.9% with Turkey in comparable terms).EfficiencyNumber of branchesNumber of employeesNumber of ATMsOperating income (Millioneuros)(1) At constant exchange rates: +16.9%Provisions and othersImpairment losses on financial assets have continued the positive trend observed along the year. As a result, the cumulative year-on-year amount fell by 4.6% (down 8.8% with Turkey in comparable terms). The above is a result of the improvement in asset quality, particularly in Spain. In the case of Mexico and South America, the evolution along the year has been stable, as was expected. In the United States, the negative performance in the first quarter impacted by the oil &amp;amp; gas portfolio has been gradually corrected as 2016 advanced and closed the fourth quarter with an amount lower than expected. Finally in Turkey, this line includes in the last three months of 2016 the allocation to contingent liabilities; this does not imply a change in trend over the average of previous quarters.Impairment losses on financial assets (Millioneuros)(1) At constant exchange rates: -4.6%.The rise in provisions can be explained by the inclusion in the fourth quarter of a charge of €577m (€404m after tax) to cover the contingency linked to the judgment of the CJEU on “mortgage floor clauses”, as mentioned above.Finally, other gains (losses), which in 2016 have risen by 16.6% compared with 2015 (up 18.2% with Turkey in comparable terms) includes the increased provisioning requirements for properties and foreclosed assets.As a result of the above, the Group’s cumulative cost of risk in 2016 (0.84%) is below both the cumulative figure through September (0.92%) and for 2015 (1,06%). Overall cost of risk (which includes impairment losses on financial assets plus provisions for real estate and foreclosed assets) was stable (0.92% in 2016) relative to that reported in the first nine months of the year (0.96%).ProfitAs a result of the above, net income from ongoing operations grew by 21.0% in year-on-year terms (up 8.4% with Turkey in comparable terms).Net income from ongoing operations (Millioneuros)(1) At constant exchange rates: +21.0%Without taking into account corporate operations for 2015, the Group’s net attributable profit posted growth of 6.4% (up 3.6% with Turkey in comparable terms), despite the difficult macroeconomic environment during the year and the need for a provision for “mortgage floor clauses” (as explained above).Net attributable profit (Millioneuros)(1) At constant exchange rates: +61.2%Earnings per share (1) (Excluding corporate operations.

The most notable factors behind the key balance sheet and activity figures are:Gross lending to customers has declined slightly by 0.6% year-on-year. Despite the good performance from new production, the domestic sector reports a reduction of 4.3% chiefly due to more sluggish activity with institutions, and because repayments in the mortgage segment continue to outstrip new production. The figure for the non-domestic sector is up 3.3%, despite the negative impact of exchange rates, as the trend remains one of strong lending, particularly in emerging geographical areas (Turkey, Mexico and South America).Non-performing loans have maintained the declining trend of previous quarters, particularly in the domestic sector (banking and real-estate activity in Spain), Turkey and Mexico. The balance of non-performing loans also declined in the United States over the last quarter.Consolidated balance sheetMillion euros31-12-16∆%31-12-1530-09-16Cash, cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits40,03936.729,28228,958Financial assets held for trading74,950(4.3)78,32675,569Other financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss2,062(10.8)2,3112,104Available-for-sale financial assets79,221(30.2)113,42686,673Loans and receivables465,977(1.2)471,828459,554Loans and advances to central banks and credit institutions40,268(14.6)47,14742,487Loans and advances to customers414,5000.1414,165406,124Debt securities11,2096.610,51610,943Held-to-maturity investments17,696n.s.-19,094Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates765(13.0)879751Tangible assets8,941(10.1)9,9449,470Intangible assets9,786(2.7)10,0529,503Other assets32,418(4.1)33,80732,951Total assets731,856(2.4)749,855724,627Financial liabilities held for trading54,675(1.0)55,20255,226Other financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss2,338(11.7)2,6492,436Financial liabilities at amortized cost589,210(2.8)606,113581,593Deposits from central banks and credit institutions98,241(9.6)108,630106,557Deposits from customers401,465(0.5)403,362385,348Debt certificates76,375(6.8)81,98076,363Other financial liabilities13,1298.112,14113,325Memorandum item: subordinated liabilities17,2307.016,10917,156Liabilities under insurance contracts9,139(2.8)9,4079,274Other liabilities21,066(0.6)21,20220,207Total liabilities676,428(2.6)694,573668,736Non-controlling interests8,0640.97,9928,324Accumulated other comprehensive income(5,458)63.0(3,349)(4,681)Shareholders’ funds52,8214.350,63952,248Total equity55,4280.355,28255,891Total equity and liabilities731,856(2.4)749,855724,627Memorandum item:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Collateral given50,5401.349,87649,969Download tableLoans and advances to customers(Millioneuros)31-12-16∆%31-12-1530-09-16 Domestic sector168,527(4.3)176,090171,775 Public sector18,326(14.6)21,47120,621 Other domestic sectors 150,201(2.9)154,620151,153Secured loans93,339(4.6)97,85294,210Other loans56,8620.256,76856,944Non-domestic sector239,0323.3231,432227,481Secured loans108,4325.3103,007105,822Other loans130,6001.7128,425121,659Non-performing loans22,915(9.5)25,33323,589Domestic sector16,388(16.0)19,49916,874Non-domestic sector6,52711.95,8346,715Loans and advances to customers (gross)430,474(0.6)432,855422,844Loan-loss provisions(15,974)(14.5)(18,691)(16,720)Loans and advances to customers414,5000.1414,165406,124Download tableCustomer fundsMillion of euros31-12-16∆%31-12-1530-09-16Deposits from customers401,465(0.5)403,362385,348Domestic sector164,075(6.3)175,142159,580Public sector6,914(55.0)15,3686,152Other domestic sectors157,161(1.6)159,774153,429 Current and savings accounts95,56821.778,50288,126 Time deposits56,120(19.0)69,32660,474 Assets sold under repurchase agreement and other5,473(54.2)11,9474,828Non-domestic sector237,1474.0227,927225,522 Current and savings accounts128,6923.9123,854119,119 Time deposits99,4090.898,59699,611 Assets sold under repurchase agreement and other9,04665.25,4776,791Subordinated liabilities243(17.2)293246Other customer funds132,0920.2131,822130,833Spain80,5651.779,18178,159Mutual funds32,6553.731,49031,566Pension funds23,4482.422,89723,103Other off-balance sheet funds51(58.3)12350Customer portfolios24,410(1.1)24,67123,440Rest of the world51,527(2.1)52,64152,674Mutual funds and investment companies22,382(2.4)22,93022,989Pension funds9,97015.38,6459,525Other off-balance sheet funds2,780(24.1)3,6633,106Customer portfolios16,395(5.8)17,40417,054Total customer funds533,557(0.3)535,184516,181Download tableLoss and advances to customers (gross) (Billion de euros)(1) At constant exchange rates: +2.1%The Group’s deposits from customers ended the year at very similar levels to 31-Dec-2015 (down 0.5%). In the domestic sector the performance was shaped by a significant fall in balances from the public sector (down 55.0%) and a decline in time deposits (down 19.0%) as a result of the drop in remuneration on these deposits in a context of very low interest rates. In contrast, current and savings accounts performed positively (up 21.7%). In thenon-domestic sector there was an increase in all deposit lines, particularly the most liquid and lower-cost ones.Off-balance sheet funds ended the year with balances practically matching those at year-end 2015 (up 0.2%). There was a positive performance in Spain, while in the rest of the world the main impact was the adverse exchange-rate effect mentioned above.Customer funds (Billion euros)(1) At constant exchange rates: +1.5%SolvencyCapital baseBBVA Group closed 2016 with a fully-loaded CET1 ratio of 10.9%. This represents a rise of 58 basis points on the figure of 10.3% at the close of 2015, thanks once more to the Group’s generation of recurring earnings and the reduction in RWA. In the fourth quarter, the fully-loaded CET1 ratio fell by 10 basis points as a result of the impact of the evolution of the markets. In addition, there were two additional impacts in the last quarter of 2016: first, the so called “mortgage floor clauses” has had a negative effect of 16 basis points; and second, the European Commission’s decision to include Turkey on its list of countries that comply with the supervisory and regulatory requirements equivalent to European standards allowed the Group to improve its capital adequacy ratios by 15 basis points.Another relevant aspect linked to the changes in the capital base is the implementation of a new “dividend-option” program in October. Owners of 87.85% of the free allocation rights opted to receive bonus BBVA shares. A total of 86,3 million ordinary shares were issued.Evolution of fully-loaded capital ratios (Percentage)In phased-in terms, the CET1 ratio was 12.2% as of 31-Dec-2016, the Tier 1 ratio was 12.9% and the total capital ratio was 15.1% These levels are above the requirements established by the ECB in its SREP letter and the systemic buffers applicable to BBVA Group for the CET1 ratio in 2016 (9.75%). Starting on January 1, 2017, this requirement has been established for the phased-in CET1 ratio (7,625%) and the total capital ratio (11,125%). Thus the current ratios are also above the ECB regulatory requirements applicable to 2017.The Group maintains a high leverage ratio: 6.5% underfully-loaded criteria (6.7% phased-in), which continues to compare very favorably with the rest of its peer group.RatingsIn 2016, BBVA’s ratings have not changed; they remain at the same levels as at the close of 2015. The last update was on April 13, when DBRS modified BBVA’s outlook from positive to stable, as a result of a similar change in Spain’s sovereign rating outlook.Rating agencyLong termShort termOutlookDBRSAR-1 (low)StableFitchA-F-2StableMoody&#39;s (1)Baa1P-2StableScope RatingsAS-1StableStandard &amp;amp; Poor&#39;sBBB+A-2Stable(1) Additionally, Moody&#39;x assigns an A3 rating to BBVA long term deposits.Capital base (1)Million eurosCRD IV phased-in31-12-16 (2)30-09-1630-06-1631-03-1631-12-15Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)47,34347,80147,55946,47148,554Tier 150,05750,54550,36448,27248,554Tier 28,81011,63511,74211,56611,646Total Capital (Tier 1+Tier 2)58,86762,18062,10659,83860,200Risk-weighted assets388,760389,814395,085399,270401,277CET1 (%)12.212.312.011.612.1Tier 1 (%) 12.913.012.712.112.1Tier 2 (%)2.33.03.02.92.9Total capital ratio (%)15.115.915.715.015.0(1) The capital ratios are calculated under CRD IV from Basel III regulation, applying a 60% phase-in for 2016 and a 40% for 2015. (2) Temporary data.Risk managementCredit riskBBVA Group has closed 2016 with a very positive trend in the main asset quality indicators.Credit risk increased by 1.7% over the quarter, and was down 0.4% since the close of December 2015 (up 2.0% and 2.4% respectively, at constant exchange rates). Credit activity has continued to be strong in Mexico, South America and Turkey. In contrast, credit risk is still declining in Spain and in the United States it shows a slight reduction, as this area is focused on selective and profitable growth.Non-performing loans have once more performed very well. Over the last three months of the year the balance fell again by 2.7% (down 9.2% year-on-year), thanks to the improvement in practically all the geographical areas, above all Banking Activity in Spain (down 1.6% over the quarter and 14.7% over the year), Real-Estate Activity in Spain (down 6.0% and 17.3% respectively), Turkey (down 8.4% and 3.3%, respectively), Mexico (down 2.9% and 10.2% respectively) and the United States (down 9.0%, although over the last twelve months they have risen by 67.0% as a result of the downgrade in ratings, basically in the first quarter, of some companies operating in the oil &amp;amp; gas sector). In South America, there was an increase of 12.8% over the quarter and 39.4% over the last twelve months.The Group’s NPL ratio has improved again (down 22 basis points over the last three months and down 48 basis points since the start of the year) to 4.9% at the close of the year.

This principle prevents the propagation of a liquidity crisis among the Group’s different areas and ensures that the cost of liquidity is correctly reflected in the price formation process.In 2016 liquidity and funding conditions remained comfortable across BBVA Group’s global footprint.The financial soundness of the Group’s banks is based on the funding of lending activity, fundamentally through the use of customer funds.In Spain and the United States, total deposits have shown a positive trend, despite the current interest-rate environment over the year as a whole and in the last quarter. The trend has also been positive in Mexico, South America and Turkey.The European Central Bank (ECB) has adopted a number of measures over the year, most notably the following: the interest-rate cut in March, the extension of the asset purchase program announced in December, and the new round of liquidity injection through the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) with a maturity of four years. BBVA participated in the program’s June auction, increasing its net take-up by €10 billion.In Mexico, the liquidity position continues to be sound, despite the market volatility following the U.S. elections. There is relatively little dependence on wholesale funding, which is basically linked to securities portfolios. The positive performance of customer funds has meant that wholesale markets could be used less, and this use was limited to the local market.In the United States, the narrowing credit gap over the year has allowed the cancellation of one issue and a reduction in wholesale funding, with the liquidity position in 2016 remaining comfortable.In Turkey, despite the geopolitical tension and Moody’s downgrade of its credit rating, the domestic environment has remained stable, without pressure on the sources of funding, supported by the measures adopted by the Central Bank of Turkey (CBRT).In the rest of the franchises, the liquidity and funding situation in both local currency and dollars has also remained stable.Over the year BBVA S.A. has accessed the wholesale markets for a total of €6.350m, using a diversified range of debt instruments, including senior debt, mortgage-coveredbonds, Additional Tier 1 (AT1) and securitization. In particular, over the last quarter of the year a successful issue of mortgage-covered bonds for €1 billion captured the attention of major investors.The long-term wholesale funding markets have remained stable in the other geographical areas where the Group operates. There have been no international securities issues. Access to stable finance in Turkey is evident from the increase in long-term wholesale funding (up €400m), the renewal of the total volume of syndicated loans (€2.400m), and foreign-currency issues (€610m) which matured in 2016.Short-term funding has also continued to perform positively, in a context marked by a high level of liquidity.With respect to the LCR liquidity ratio, BBVA Group keeps levels over 100%, clearly higher than demanded by regulations (over 70% in 2016), both at Group level and in all its banking subsidiaries.Foreign exchangeForeign-exchange risk management of BBVA’s long-term investments, basically stemming from its franchises abroad, aims to preserve the Group’s capital adequacy ratios and ensure the stability of its income statement.The year 2016 was marked mainly by the electoral process in the U.S. and its impact on the dollar and Mexican peso,the ECB’s quantitative easing (QE) measures, the delay in interest hikes by the Federal Reserve (FED) until December,the result of the Brexit referendum and uncertainty inTurkey.Against this background, BBVA has maintained a policy of actively hedging its main investments in emerging economies: the hedge on average covers between 30% and 50% of the earnings expected for the following year and around 70% of the excess of the CET1 ratio (what is not naturally covered by the ratio itself). In accordance with this policy, at the close of December 2016 the sensitivity of the CET1 ratio to a depreciation of 10% of the main emerging currencies (Mexican peso or Turkish lira) against the euro would be limited to less than 2 basis points, and the coverage level of the expected earnings for the next year in these two countries would be 50% in Mexico and 70% in Turkey.Interest ratesThe aim of managing interest-rate risk is to maintain a sustained growth of net interest income in the short and medium term, irrespective of interest-rate fluctuations, while controlling the impact on the capital adequacy ratio through the valuation of the portfolio of available-for-sale assets.In 2016, the results of this management have been satisfactory, with limited risk strategies in all the Group’s banks aimed at improving profitability. The amount of NTI generated in Europe and the United States is the result of prudent portfolio management strategies, particularly of sovereign debt, in a context marked by low interest rates. Portfolios are also held in Mexico, Turkey and South America, mainly of sovereign debt, to manage the balance-sheet structure.Finally, the political uncertainties generated by Brexit and the U.S. elections have had a limited impact on the debt markets. No major increases have been observed in either the sovereign debt spreads or those of BBVA, so their effect on NTI and the valuation of the ALCO portfolios has been limited. In Mexico, the Central Bank (Banxico) has tried to contain inflation and protect the peso by five interest-rate hikes totaling 250 basis points over 2016, leaving the monetary policy rate at 5.75%, the highest since 2009. In Turkey, the markets have shown resilience despite the volatility, mainly due to geopolitical factors. As a result, the year has closed with a risk premium in line with the close of 2015. The CBRT, which had been lowering rates for the first three quarters of 2016, raised them in November, in response to the slight slowdown in growth and the weakness of the Turkish lira.Economic capitalAttributable economic risk capital (ERC) consumption at the close of December stood at €37.665m in consolidated terms, a year-on-year decline of 6.9% (1). This performance is mainly the result of the depreciation against the euro of some local currencies (mainly the Turkish Lira, Mexican and Argentine pesos and Venezuelan bolivar). In constant terms, theyear-on-year decline is 3.4%. The decline is mainly focused on fixed-income (spread) and equity ERC, due to the reduction in the “available-for-sale” portfolio, as well as market risk. In contrast, there were increases over the year in ERC in structural exchange-rate risk and operational risk.Attributable economic risk capital breakdown (Percentage as of December 2016)(1) The rate of change is calculated against the consolidated data of the close of December2015 in comparable terms (€40,461m). This includes the annual effect of updating themethodology and asset risk parameters at the close of the year (Mexico, South America, theUnited States, Garanti and CX), the revision of the models for other risks and the start ofimputing new types of risks (fixed-income spread and other risks), in accordance with theclassification required for 2016, as compared with the official consolidated data for the closeof 2015 (€34,998m).The BBVA shareGlobal growth improved in the second half of 2016 (estimated at 0.8% for the third quarter and 0.9% for the fourth). Developed countries are speeding up their growth thanks to improved confidence and a stronger industrial sector, which is also having an effect on the Chinese economy. The performance of the rest of the emerging economies is uneven, but in general the trend is for recovery. The improvement in global trade also appears to be confirmed, after a weak first half of the year.Against this backdrop, the performance of the mainstock-market indices has varied greatly over the last twelve months. The Stoxx 50 lost 2.9%, while in the Eurozone the Euro Stoxx 50 gained 0.7% and in Spain, the Ibex 35 fell by 2.0%. The S&amp;amp;P 500, which tracks the share prices of U.S. companies, closed the year up 9.5%, most of the gain being in the second half of the year.In the banking sector, the Stoxx Banks index of European banks, including those in the United Kingdom, slowed its decline of the first half of the year, and closed 2016 with a decline of 6.8%. The same trend is reflected in the Eurozone bank index, the Euro Stoxx Banks, which lost 8.0%. In the United States, the S&amp;amp;P Regional Banks sector index gained 32.4% in 2016, with the growth focused at the end the year following the results of the U.S. elections.The BBVA share performed relatively better in 2016 than the European banking system as a whole. As of December 31, 2016, the BBVA share price was €6,41, a rise over the quarter of 19.2% and a year-on-year decline of 4.8%.BBVA share evolution compared with European indices (Base indice 100=31-12-05)The BBVA share and share performance ratios31-12-1631-12-15Number of shareholders935,284934,244Number of shares issued6,566,615,2426,366,680,118Daily average number of shares traded47,180,85546,641,017Daily average trading (millioneuros)272393Maximum price (euros)6.889.77Minimum price (euros)4.506.70Closing price (euros)6.416.74Book value per share (euros)7.227.47Tangible book value per share (euros)5.735.88Market capitalization (million euros)42,11842,905Yield (dividend/price; %) (1))5.85.5(1) Calculated by dividing shareholder remuneration over the last twelve months over the closing price at the end of the period.As regards shareholder remuneration, two cash dividends have been paid for a gross €0,08 per share each.

The “TCR Communication” project helps customers make informed decisions, ensuring that BBVA’s relationship with them is transparent, clear and responsible in each interaction. In this way we strengthen the relationship of trust and we gain their loyalty, so they recommend us to other potential customers.In 2016 we have worked in three areas. We have continued to expand the number of products and services that have TCR leaflets, we have worked on making contracts TCR and we have made sure that the language used in online banking conversations and in the replies to their complaints is in line with these principles. We have also continued to work on digital projects hand in hand with the development and usability teams.Clarity and transparency are not only achieved through the “TCR Communication” project. The Commitment and Transparency Foundation (Fundación Compromiso y Transparencia) has also ranked BBVA second on the list of companies that best inform of their fiscal responsibility in the Ibex 35 index.SocietyProducts with a high social impactBBVA and the European Investment Bank (EIB) have joined forces for the third time to boost funding for small and medium-sized enterprises, provide liquidity and help them with their investments.Moreover, BBVA is committed to sustainable funding strategies and is incorporating environmental and social criteria into its products to generate a positive impact. This commitment is reflected in the Bloomberg ranking, where BBVA is the first Spanish financial institution as issuer of green bonds.Social programsIn Spain, the fifth edition of the Territorios Solidarios project has taken place. This initiative offers the Bank’s employees the chance to put forward non-profit organizations which are then voted by the rest of staff and can win up to 10.000 euros to fund a project within their area of activity. This year, 1.650.000 euros have been distributed.The 8th Integra Awards have also been held to recognize the innovative initiatives that generate quality employment for people with disabilities in Spain. A total of €3m have been granted in the seven years of the awards so far, 700 jobs have been created for people with disabilities and a further 4.000 jobs have been maintained.Meanwhile, BBVA Bancomer and Seguros Bancomer have received from the Mexican Center for Philanthropy (Cemefi) the “Socially Responsible Company” recognition, which is awarded to all leading companies in the field of social responsibility that have certifiable standards in community involvement and support for the populations over which they have an influence. This recognition was awarded for the first time in 2000. BBVA Bancomer has been the only bank to receive this recognition for more than fifteen years.Lastly, as regards housing, an agreement was signed in July between BBVA Group and the Regional Government of Catalonia for the implementation of a social housing project. BBVA will transfer 1.800 homes to the Regional Government for families in a situation of social vulnerability. The Regional Government will implement a social insertion plan as part of this agreement.Financial literacyThe Institute for Financial Literacy, a non-governmental organization based in the United States, has awarded the recognition Excellence in Financial Literacy Education to BBVA Bancomer for the approach and the results of its financial literacy program “Adelante con tu futuro” (Forward with your future), in the “Organization of the Year” category.With the aim of raising awareness of the importance of financial literacy in the lives of people, and helping to train consumers to be more aware and better informed about banking products, BBVA Chile has just implemented its new web site. educacionfinancierabbva.cl. Over 10.300 young people in Chile, of whom 60% live in remote regions far from the capital, have taken part this year in Liga de Educación Financiera BBVA (BBVA Financial Literacy League), a program designed to teach good financial habits to students aged 14 to 17.For the second year in a row, the BBVA Provincial Foundation has held the ceremony for the presentation of its “Adelante con la educación” (Forward with education) awards. Their aim is to recognize students and teachers who participate in its educational programs.Knowledge, science and cultureThe “Acción Magistral 2016” (Teacher Action) Awards, organized by the FAD, the Spanish Commission for Cooperation Responsible banking with UNESCO and BBVA, have once more recognized the best teaching projects that provide education in values. The registration period has been opened for these awards, which offer an incentive to teachers who want to go beyond their daily obligations and make an effort to instill in their classrooms values such as solidarity and respect for others.The BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Awards have recognized, once more, the most prominent researchers in their respective fields, some of them focused on social and environmental issues.The BBVA Foundation has launched a call for new aid for “Scientific Research Teams and Cultural Researchers and Creators”. The aim is to support the development of projects that are characterized by an innovative spirit in areas such as ecology and big data.Fundéu BBVA continues to be a benchmark in the world of letters. In 2016, in partnership with Molino de Ideas, it studied the development of printed press in Spain from 1914 to 2014 as part of the Aracne project. Its work will boost the use of Spanish and offer a complete picture of how society changes through language.EntrepreneurshipInnovationBBVA Bancomer has opened the first Innovation Center in the banking sector in Mexico as a meeting point for the country’s innovation ecosystem (entrepreneurs, developers and startups). The BBVA Innovation Centers were launched four years ago in Madrid, Colombia and the United States. Their success is reflected in three main figures: over 20.000 visits received, 200 events in BBVA CIB, Madrid, a websitewith more than a million visits and 100.000 followers on Facebook.Microfinance FoundationThe Microfinance Foundation has continued to give access to financial products for the most disadvantaged groups, with special emphasis on women as generators of wealth in Latin American countries. 61% of the entrepreneurs it supports with loans and advice are women. In 2016, the Foundation’s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund (SDG-F) was renewed until 2019. It has also participated in the United Nations high-level panel on women’s economic empowerment in Latin America. The event revolved around the economic gap between men and women in Latin America and the Caribbean.To show all the efforts made, the BBVA Microfinance Foundation has presented its 2015 Social Performance Report “Measuring What Really Matters” at the Institute of International Finance in Washington.Over the year, the Foundation has received many recognitions for its work. Worth mentioning are the ECOFIN Awards as the best “International Brand-Image of Spain” in 2016.",

      "content"  : "Introduction Management ReportIntroductionBBVA is a customer-centric global financial services group founded in 1857. It has presence in 35 countries. The Group has a solid position in Spain; it is the largest financial institution in Mexico and leading franchises in South America and the Sunbelt region of the United States. It is also Turkish bank Garanti’s leading shareholder. Its diversified business is biased on high-growth markets and it relies on technology as a key sustainable competitive advantage.BBVA has a responsible banking model based on seeking out a return adjusted to principles, legal compliance, best practices and the creation of long-term value for all its stakeholders.StrategyBBVA Group is immersed in a transformation process necessary to adapt to the new environment of the financial industry and preserve its leadership. Success in this new environment requires a more selective approach, involving a redefinition of the value proposition and the adaptation of the universal banking business model.In this context, the goal of BBVA Group’s transformation strategy is to strengthen its relationship with its customers. This strategy is structured around a Purpose and six Strategic Priorities, which are the pillars buttressing not only the strategic plans across all the Group’s regions and areas but also the culture of the Organization as a whole.In 2016, BBVA Group made significant progress on its Transformation Journey. It has strengthened the Entity’s new strategy, with particular focus on digitalization and customer experience, and has simplified the organizational structure.Our vision: A new environment for the financial industrya) DigitalizationDigitalization is making an impact on the financial industry, since it can satisfy the new demands of customers in various ways.Firstly, the entry of mobile devices has led to changes in the distribution model. Mobile devices have become the main channel of contact.Moreover, new developments in technology (big data, artificial intelligence, Blockchain, the cloud, data processing, biometry, etc.) represent a major advance in customer experience.New technologies foster the democratization of financial services: the entire world will be able to gain access to better and more sophisticated services that were up to now only available for high-value segments.New technologies foster the democratization of financial services: the entire world will be able to gain access to better and more sophisticated services that were up to now only available for high-value segments.Additionally, new, specialized players are entering the financial industry and successfully tackling parts of the value chain (payments, financing, asset management, insurance, etc.). Their disruptive proposals are primarily based on improving customer experience and enhancing specialization in certain products. These players include FinTech companies and large digital corporations (Google, Amazon, etc.), which are now competing with banks in the new environment.In conclusion, traditional banking should respond by becoming more competitive and providing value-added solutions, with greater focus on customer experience and the development of their digital offering.b)Shift in consumer behaviorCustomers are asking for a new type of banking relationship and have begun demanding new services based on new needs. We are currently in an environment where consumers are permanently connected; they are already accustomed to digital experiences and the use of multiple devices and applications. They are also calling for greater transparency and trust in their banking relationship, in addition to enhanced customization, accessibility and convenience in financial services in order to achieve their own goals in life.Furthermore, a socio-demographic shift is underway that should also be considered. The Millennial Generation has a clearly digital profile and is becoming a new group of consumers requiring services. Digitalization is reaching the adult population, while the middle class in emerging countries is also increasing their digital potential.Our aspirationIn this context, the main objective of the BBVA Group’s transformation strategy, i.e. our aspiration, is to strengthen the relationship with our customers. We want to help our customers take the best decisions (banking and non-banking) through an attractive experience (clear, simple, transparent, based on fair conditions and concepts of prudence and integrity), and provide them the appropriate assistance and advice in order to cover all their financial needs.BBVA Transformation JourneyWe have taken great strides in 2016 to fulfill our Purpose: “To bring the age of opportunity to everyone”. We want to help our customers achieve their goals in life. We want to go beyond being a bank and become a vehicle of opportunities with a positive impact on the lives of people and on the business of companies.In line with our Purpose, significant steps have also been taken in the development of the Group’s six Strategic Priorities to make headway in our transformation process.Strategic Priorities1.

Digital sales by geography (Percentage of total sales YTD, number of transactions)(1) Figures have been restated due to changes in the inclusion of some products3. New business modelsIn 2016 a major effort was also made to develop new business models, taking advantage of the FinTech ecosystem to develop our value proposition, basically leveraged on four drivers:Internal incubator; a model that combines internal talent and know-how with the partnership of “resident” entrepreneurs. As a result of this process we already have our first beta version company on the market: BBVA Open Platform. It is a pioneer in opening APIs (application programming interfaces) for third parties, with more than 100 users in the testing environment in Spain and over 300 in the United States.Strategic alliances, with four agreements reached during the year (Dwolla, Google, Prosper and R3).Merger &amp;amp;Acquisitions, such as Holvi, Atom and the conclusion of a purchase agreement for the Mexican company Openpay.Acquisitions by means of venture capital: Propel Venture Partners (Propel) is the new independent venture-capital firm that manages BBVA funds destined for startups that use technology for changing financial services for the benefit of our customers. BBVA has allocated US$250 million for investment in FinTech companies, and these funds will be managed by the Propel team.4. Optimizing capital allocationThe objective of this priority is centered on improving the profitability and sustainability of the business while simplifying and focusing it in on the most relevant activities.We have been working throughout 2016 to adapt and make our business model more efficient, profitable and dynamic. A number of initiatives (business portfolio optimization, capital tracking committees in all geographic areas, etc.) have been launched that have ensured BBVA Group will achieve solid capital adequacy ratios. In this regard, at the end of 2016, BBVA Group had a fully-loaded CET1 of 10.9%, which represents a rise of 58 basis points on the figure of 10.3% at the close of 2015.5. Unrivaled efficiencyIn an environment of lower profit yields for the financial industry, efficiency has become an essential priority in the BBVA transformation plan. This priority is based on building a new organizational model as agile, simple and automated as possible.In this regard, in 2016 we identified the key levers and developed the action plans necessary to make this change a reality. We are thus transforming our distribution model, systems architecture, operational model, organizational structures and processes. And we are doing so withoutlosing sight of providing a new standard in customer experience.6. A first class workforceOur priority at BBVA entails attracting, developing, motivating and retaining a first-class workforce, providing the best employee experience and bringing corporate culture intoline with the Group’s transformation process and itsPurpose.Achieving our objectives involves transforming the Organization by implementing new ways of working (organization based on projects, communities of expertise, agile methodology, collaborative tools, etc.) and boosting a culture of collaboration and entrepreneurship, with flatter structures. We have also launched a new model of variable remuneration, aligned with BBVA’s strategic objectives. These initiatives will help ensure that BBVA is the best placeto work.Bringing the BBVA Purpose to lifeA year ago, BBVA’s new Purpose, to bring the age of opportunity to everyone, was communicated internally to all our employees.We’re starting 2017 by communicating externally our message of bringing the age of opportunity to the communities we serve. We are doing that through the launch of our new corporate tagline: Creating Opportunities. This tagline was also the result of a collaborative effort. The final choice was the winner in every consumer survey.Years ago, Adelante was an invitation to move forward. Now, we’re inviting people and businesses to explore the opportunities that exist in a world where the access to knowledge through technology is opening all sorts of possibilities. At BBVA, we view ourselves as enablers to help people make better financial decisions, so they can seize opportunities, wherever they may be.The new tagline comes with a bold new brand identity designed to create a stronger emotional connection through our different consumer touch points. Throughout 2017, this new BBVA Brand will be expressed in our online/mobile banking experience, through our advertising, in our social media, through the way the brand looks. We’re committed to building an even more powerful BBVA Brand. That means making our Brand more attractive, not only visually, but providing it with more meaning.Responsible banking modelAt BBVA we have a differential banking model that we refer to as responsible banking.In 2016 the governance of the responsible banking model has been strengthened. Furthermore, this year a new Plan 2016-2018 has been approved, with four main initiatives for the coming years:Creation of lasting and more balanced relationships with our customers through transparent, clear and responsible communication and financial literacy in the solutions that we offer.Full integration of how we do business through responsible business policies, a reputational risk model, and a peoplecentric culture throughout the Organization.Promotion of responsible and sustainable growth through financial inclusion, sustainable finance, support for SMEs and responsible investment.Investment in the community, with priority for financial literacy initiatives for society, entrepreneurship, knowledge and other social causes that are relevant from a local point of view.This responsible banking model is supervised by the Board of Directors and coordinated through the Group’s Responsible Business unit.Business organizational chart and structureBBVA announced in July 2016 that it would simplify its organizational structure to streamline and accelerate transformation.The main changes include direct reporting of the main business areas and geographies to the CEO, and the integration of key areas in Customer Solutions to develop our value proposal for customers globally and locally.The new organizational chart is divided into four areas: Execution &amp;amp; Performance, New Core Competences, Risk &amp;amp; Finance and Strategy &amp;amp; Control. The CEO handles the first three functions while the Group Executive Chairman handles Strategy &amp;amp; Control.BBVA Group.

      "content"  : "SubirNotes to the interim consolidated financial statements.1. Introduction, basis for the presentation of the consolidated financial statements, internal control of financial information and other information.1.1 IntroductionBanco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. (hereinafter “the Bank” or “BBVA”) is a private-law entity subject to the laws and regulations governing banking entities operating in Spain. It carries out its activity through branches and agencies across the country and abroad.The Bylaws and other public information are available for inspection at the Bank’s registered address (Plaza San Nicolás, 4 Bilbao) as on its web site (www.bbva.com).In addition to the activities it carries out directly, the Bank heads a group of subsidiaries, joint venture and associates which perform a wide range of activities and which together with the Bank constitute the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria Group (hereinafter, “the Group” or “the BBVA Group”). In addition to its own separate financial statements, the Bank is therefore required to prepare the Group’s consolidated financial statements.As of December 31, 2016, the BBVA Group had 370 consolidated entities and 89 entities accounted for using the equity method (see Notes 3 and 16 Appendix I to V).The consolidated financial statements of the BBVA Group for the year ended December 31, 2015 were approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meetings (“AGM”) on March 11, 2016.BBVA Group’s consolidated financial statements and the financial statements for the Bank and most of the remaining entities within the Group have been prepared as of December 31, 2016, and are pending approval by their respective AGMs. Notwithstanding, the Board of Directors of the Bank understands that said financial statements will be approved without changes.1.2 Basis for the presentation of the consolidated financial statementsThe BBVA Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards endorsed by the European Union (hereinafter, “EU-IFRS”) applicable as of December 31, 2016, considering the Bank of Spain Circular 4/2004, of 22 December (and as amended thereafter), and with any other legislation governing financial reporting applicable to the Group in Spain.The BBVA Group’s accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 were prepared by the Group’s Directors (through the Board of Directors held on February 9, 2016) by applying the principles of consolidation, accounting policies and valuation criteria described in Note 2, so that they present fairly the Group’s total consolidated equity and financial position as of December 31, 2016, together with the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows generated during the year ended December 31, 2016.These consolidated financial statements were prepared on the basis of the accounting records kept by the Bank and each of the other entities in the Group. Moreover, they include the adjustments and reclassifications required to harmonize the accounting policies and valuation criteria used by the Group (see Note 2.2).All effective accounting standards and valuation criteria with a significant effect in the consolidated financial statements were applied in their preparation.The amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of euros, unless it is more appropriate to use smaller units. Some items that appear without a total in these consolidated financial statements do so because of how the units are expressed. Also, in presenting amounts in millions of euros, the accounting balances have been rounded up or down. It is therefore possible that the totals appearing in some tables are not the exact arithmetical sum of their component figures.The percentage changes in amounts have been calculated using figures expressed in thousands of euros.1.3 Comparative informationThe consolidated financial statements of BBVA Group for the year 2016 are prepared in accordance with the presentation models required by Circular 5/2015 of the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores. The aim is to adapt the content of the public financial information from the credit institutions and formats of the financial statements established mandatory by the European Union regulation for the credit institution.The information included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the explanatory notes referring to December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2015 are presented exclusively for the purpose of comparison with the information for December 31, 2016. In order to facility the comparison, the financial statements and the information referred of those dates of 2015 and 2014, has been restated according to the new models mentioned in the previous paragraph. As shown in Appendix XIV attached, the presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with these new formats has no significant impact on the financial statements included in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.Certain financial information for the year 2015 has been restated, with no significant impact, as a result of the end in 2016 of the purchase accounting period related to the Garanti Group acquisition (July 2015), as required by IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” paragraph 49 (see Note 18).Likewise, during 2016, the BBVA Group operating segments have not been significant changes with regard to the existing structure in 2015 (Note 6). The information related to operating segments as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 has been restated for comparability purposes, as required by IFRS 8 “Operating segments”.1.4 Seasonal nature of income and expensesThe nature of the most significant activities carried out by the BBVA Group’s entities is mainly related to traditional activities carried out by financial institutions, which are not significantly affected by seasonal factors within the same year.1.5 Responsibility for the information and for the estimates madeThe information contained in the BBVA Group’s consolidated financial statements is the responsibility of the Group’s Directors.Estimates have to be made at times when preparing these consolidated financial statements in order to calculate the recorded amount of some assets, liabilities, income, expenses and commitments. These estimates relate mainly to the following:Impairment on certain financial assets (see Notes 7, 12, 13, 14 and 16).The assumptions used to quantify certain provisions (see Notes 24 and 25) and for the actuarial calculation of post-employment benefit liabilities and commitments (see Note 25).The useful life and impairment losses of tangible and intangible assets (see Notes 17, 18, 20 and 21).The valuation of goodwill and price allocation of business combinations (see Note 18).The fair value of certain unlisted financial assets and liabilities (see Notes 7, 8, 10, 11 and 12).The recoverability of deferred tax assets (See Note 19).The Exchange rate and the inflation rate of Venezuela (see Notes 2.2.16 and 2.2.20).Although these estimates were made on the basis of the best information available as of December 31, 2016 on the events analyzed, future events may make it necessary to modify them (either up or down) over the coming years. This would be done prospectively in accordance with applicable standards, recognizing the effects of changes in the estimates in the corresponding consolidated income statement.1.6 BBVA Group’s Internal Control over financial reportingThe financial information prepared by the BBVA Group is subject to an Internal Control over Financial Reporting (hereinafter “ICFR”), which provides reasonable assurance with respect to its reliability and the integrity of the consolidated financial information. It is also aimed to ensure that the transactions are processed in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. The ICFR was developed by the BBVA Group’s management in accordance with the framework established by the “Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission” (hereinafter, “COSO”). The COSO framework sets five components that constitute the basis of the effectiveness and efficiency of the internal control systems:The establishment of an appropriate control framework.The assessment of the risks that could arise during the preparation of the financial information.The design of the necessary controls to mitigate the identified risks.The establishment of an appropriate system of information to detect and report system weaknesses.The monitoring of the controls to ensure they perform correctly and are effective over time.The ICFR is a dynamic model that evolves continuously over time to reflect the reality of the BBVA Group’s businesses, processes, risks and controls designed to mitigate them. It is subject to a continuous evaluation by the internal control units located in the different entities of BBVA Group.These internal control units are integrated within the BBVA internal control model which is based in two pillars:A control system organized into three lines of defense:The first line are integrated by the business units, which are responsible for identifying risks associated with their processes and to execute the controls established to mitigate them.The second line comprises the specialized control units (Legal Compliance, Global Accounting &amp;amp; Information Management/Internal Financial Control, Internal Risk Control, IT Risk, Fraud &amp;amp; Security, and Operations Control among others).This second line defines the models and control policies under their areas of responsibility and monitors the design and the correct implementation and effectiveness of the controlsThe third line is the Internal Audit unit, which conducts an independent review of the model, verifying the compliance and effectiveness of the model.A set of committees called Corporate Assurance that helps to escalate the internal control issues to the management at a Group level and also in each of the countries where the Group operates.The internal control units comply with a common and standard methodology established at Group level, as set out in the following diagram:The Internal Control Units, ICFR Model is subject to annual evaluations by the Group’s Internal Audit Unit and external auditors. It is also supervised by the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Bank’s Board of Directors.The BBVA Group also complies with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (hereafter “SOX”) for consolidated financial statements as a listed company in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The main senior executives of the Group take part in the design, compliance and implementation of the internal control model to make it efficient and to ensure the quality and accuracy of the financial information.The description of the Internal Financial Control System for financial information is detailed in the Corporate Governance Annual Report, which is included within the Management Report attached to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016.1.7 Mortgage market policies and proceduresThe information on “Mortgage market policies and procedures” (for the granting of mortgage loans and for debt issues secured by such mortgage loans) required by Bank of Spain Circular 5/2011, applying Royal Decree 716/2009, dated April 24 (which developed certain aspects of Act 2/1981, dated March 25, on the regulation of the mortgage market and other mortgage and financial market regulations), can be found in Appendix X.2. Principles of consolidation, accounting policies and measurement bases applied and recent IFRS pronouncementsThe Glossary includes the definition of some of the financial and economic terms used in Note 2 and subsequent Notes.2.1 Principles of consolidationIn terms of its consolidation, in accordance with the criteria established by the IFRS, the BBVA Group is made up of four types of entities: subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and structured entities, defined as follows:SubsidiariesSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group (for definition of the criterion for control, see Glossary).The financial statements of the subsidiaries are fully consolidated with those of the Bank. The share of noncontrolling interests from subsidiaries in the Group’s consolidated total equity is presented under the heading “Non-controlling interests” in the consolidated balance sheet. Their share in the profit or loss for the period or year is presented under the heading “Attributable to minority interest” in the accompanying consolidated income statement (see Note 31).Note 3 includes information related to the main subsidiaries in the Group as of December 31, 2016. Appendix I includes other significant information on these entities.Joint venturesJoint ventures are those entities over which there is a joint arrangement to joint control with third parties other than the Group (for definitions of joint arrangement, joint control and joint venture, refer to Glossary)The investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method (see Note 16). Appendix II shows the main figures for joint ventures accounted for using the equity method.AssociatesAssociates are entities in which the Group is able to exercise significant influence (for definition of significant influence, see Glossary). Significant influence is deemed to exist when the Group owns 20% or more of the voting rights of an investee directly or indirectly, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case. However, certain entities in which the Group owns 20% or more of the voting rights are not included as Group associates, since the Group does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these entities. Investments in these entities, which do not represent material amounts for the Group, are classified as “Available-for-sale financial assets”.In contrast, some investments in entities in which the Group holds less than 20% of the voting rights are accounted for as Group associates, as the Group is considered to have the ability to exercise significant influence over these entities. As of December 31, 2016, these entities are not significant in the Group.Appendix II shows the most significant information related to the associates (see Note 16), which are accounted for using the equity method.Structured EntitiesA structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when the voting rights relate to administrative matters only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements (see Glossary).In those cases where the Group sets up entities or has a holding in such entities, in order to allow its customers access to certain investments, to transfer risks or for other purposes, in accordance with internal criteria and procedures and with applicable regulations, the Group determines whether control over the entity in question actually exists and therefore whether it should be subject to consolidation.Such methods and procedures determine whether there is control by the Group, considering how the decisions are made about the relevant activities, assesses whether the Group has all power over the relevant elements, exposure, or rights, to variable returns from involvement with the investee and the ability to use power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns.Structured entities subject to consolidationTo determine if a structured entity is controlled by the Group, and therefore should be consolidated into the Group, the existing contractual rights (different from the voting rights) are analyzed. For this reason, an analysis of the structure and purpose of each investee is performed and, among others, the following factors will be considered:Evidence of the current ability to manage the relevant activities of the investee according to the specific business needs (including any decisions that may arise only in particular circumstances).Potential existence of a special relationship with the investee.Implicit or explicit Group commitments to support the investee.The ability to use the Group´s power over the investee to affect the amount of the Group’s returns.There are cases where the Group has a high exposure to variable returns and retains decision-making power over the investee, either directly or through an agent.The main structured entities of the Group are the so-called asset securitization funds, to which the BBVA Group transferred loans and receivables portfolios, and other vehicles, which allow the Group’s customers to gain access to certain investments or to allow for the transfer of risks and other purposes (See Appendix I and V). The BBVA Group maintains the decision-making power over the relevant activities of these vehicles and financial support through securitized market standard contractual. The most common ones are: investment positions in equity note tranches, funding through subordinated debt, credit enhancements through derivative instruments or liquidity lines, management rights of defaulted securitized assets, “clean-up” call derivatives, and asset repurchase clauses by the grantor.For these reasons, the loans and receivable portfolios related to the vast majority of the securitizations carried out by the Bank or Group subsidiaries are not deregistered in the books of said entity and the issuances of the related debt securities are registered as liabilities within the Group’s consolidated balance sheet.Non-consolidated structured entitiesThe Group owns other vehicles also for the purpose of allowing access to customers to certain investment, transfer risks, and other purposes, but without the Group having control of the vehicles and are not consolidated in accordance with IFRS 10. The balance of assets and liabilities of these vehicles is not material in relation to the Group’s consolidated financial statements.As of December 31, 2016, there was no material financial support from the Bank or subsidiaries to unconsolidated structured entities.The Group does not consolidate any of the mutual funds it managed since the necessary control conditions are not met (see definition of control in the Glossary). Particularly, the BBVA Group does not act as arranger but as agent since it operates the mutual funds on behalf and for the benefit of investors or parties (arranger of arrangers) and, for this reason it does not control the mutual funds when exercising its authority for decision making.On the other hand, the mutual funds managed by the Group are not considered structured entities (generally, retail funds without corporate identity over which investors have participations which gives them ownership of said managed equity). These funds are not dependent on a capital structure that could prevent them to carry out activities without additional financial support, being in any case insufficient as far as the activities themselves are concerned. Additionally, the risk of the investment is absorbed by the fund participants, and the Group is only exposed when it becomes a participant, and as such, there is no other risk for the Group.In all cases, results of equity method investees acquired by the BBVA Group in a particular period are included taking into account only the period from the date of acquisition to the financial statements date. Similarly, the results of entities disposed of during any year are included taking into account only the period from the start of the year to the date of disposal.The financial statements of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the Group relate to the same date of presentation than the consolidated financial statements. If financial statements at those same dates are not available, the most recent will be used, as long as these are not older than three months, and adjusting to take into account the most significant transactions. As of December 31, 2016, save for the case of the financial statements of 5 associates and joint-ventures deemed non-significant (four of which presented financial statements as of November 30, 2016 and one as of October 31, 2016), all of the financial statements of all Group entities were available.Our banking subsidiaries, associates and joint venture around the world, are subject to supervision and regulation from a variety of regulatory bodies in relation to, among other aspects, the satisfaction of minimum capital requirements. The obligation to satisfy such capital requirements may affect the ability of such entities to transfer funds in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. In addition, under the laws of the various jurisdictions where such entities are incorporated, dividends may only be paid out through funds legally available for such purpose. Even when the minimum capital requirements are met and funds are legally available, the relevant regulator or other public administrations could discourage or delay the transfer of funds to the Group in the form of cash, dividends, loans or advances for prudential reasons.Separate financial statementsThe separate financial statements of the parent company of the Group (Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A.) are prepared under Spanish regulations (Circular 4/2004 of the Bank of Spain, and subsequent amendments) and following other regulatory requirements of financial information applicable to the Bank. The Bank uses the cost method to account in its separate financial statements its investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture entities, which are consistent with the requirements of Bank of Spain Circular 4/2004 and IAS 27.Appendix IX shows BBVA’s financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and 2016.2.2 Accounting policies and valuation criteria appliedThe accounting standards and policies and the valuation criteria applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements may differ from those used by some of the entities within the BBVA Group. For this reason, necessary adjustments and reclassifications have been made in the consolidation process to standardize these principles and criteria and comply with the EU-IFRS.The accounting standards and policies and valuation criteria used in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements are as follows:2.2.1 Financial instrumentsMeasurement of financial instruments and recognition of changes in subsequent fair valueAll financial instruments are initially accounted for at fair value which, unless there is evidence to the contrary, shall be the transaction price.Excluding all trading derivatives not considered as economic hedges, all the changes in the fair value of the financial instruments arising from the accrual of interests and similar items are recognized under the headings “Interest income” or “Interest expenses”, as appropriate, in the accompanying consolidated income statement for the year in which the change occurred (see Note 37). The dividends received from other entities, other than associate entities and joint venture entities, are recognized under the heading “Dividend income” in the accompanying consolidated income statement for the year in which the right to receive them arises (see Note 38).The changes in fair value after the initial recognition, for reasons other than those mentioned in the preceding paragraph, are treated as described below, according to the categories of financial assets and liabilities.“Financial assets and liabilities held for trading” and “Financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss”The assets and liabilities recognized under these headings of the consolidated balance sheets are measured upon acquisition at fair value and changes in the fair value (gains or losses) are recognized as their net value under the heading “Gains (losses) on financial assets and liabilities (net)” in the accompanying consolidated income statements (see Note 41). Except those interests derivatives designated as economic hedges on interest rate are registered in interest income or expense (Note 37), depending on where the result of the hedging instrument. However, changes in fair value resulting from variations in foreign exchange rates are recognized under the heading “Exchange differences (net)” in the accompanying consolidated income statements.“Available-for-sale financial assets”Assets recognized under this heading in the consolidated balance sheets are measured at their fair value. Subsequent changes in fair value (gains or losses) are recognized temporarily for their amount net of tax effect, under the heading “Accumulated other comprehensive income- Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Available-for-sale financial assets” in the consolidated balance sheets.Changes in the value of non-monetary items resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates are recognized temporarily under the heading “Accumulated other comprehensive income- Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Exchange differences” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Changes in foreign exchange rates resulting from monetary items are recognized under the heading “Exchange differences (net)” in the accompanying consolidated income statements.The amounts recognized under the headings “Accumulated other comprehensive income- Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Available-for-sale financial assets” and “Accumulated other comprehensive income- Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Exchange differences” continue to form part of the Group’s consolidated equity until the corresponding asset is derecognized from the consolidated balance sheet or until an impairment loss is recognized in the corresponding financial instrument. If these assets are sold, these amounts are derecognized and included under the headings “Gains (losses) on financial assets and liabilities (net)” or “Exchange differences (net)”, as appropriate, in the consolidated income statement for the year in which they are derecognized.The net impairment losses in “Available-for-sale financial assets” over the year are recognized under the heading “Impairment losses on financial assets (net) – Other financial instruments not at fair value through profit or loss” (see Note 47) in the consolidated income statements for that period.“Loans and receivables”, “Held-to-maturity investments” and “Financial liabilities at amortized cost”Assets and liabilities recognized under these headings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are measured once acquired at “amortized cost” using the “effective interest rate” method. This is because the consolidated entities generally intend to hold such financial instruments to maturity.Net impairment losses of assets recognized under these headings arising in each period are recognized under the heading “Impairment or (-) reversal of impairment on financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss – loans and receivables”, “Impairment or (-) reversal of impairment on financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss - held to maturity investments” or “Impairment or (-) reversal of impairment on financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss – financial assets measured at cost” (see Note 47) in the consolidated income statement for that period.“Derivatives-Hedge Accounting” and “Fair value changes of the hedged items in portfolio hedges of interestrate risk”Assets and liabilities recognized under these headings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are measured at fair value.Changes occurring subsequent to the designation of the hedging relationship in the measurement of financial instruments designated as hedged items as well as financial instruments designated as hedge accounting instruments are recognized as follows:In fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized under the heading “Gains or losses from hedge accounting, net” in the consolidated income statement, with a corresponding item under the headings where hedging items (“Hedging derivatives”) and the hedged items are recognized, as applicable. Almost all of the hedges used by the Group are for interest-rate risks. Therefore, the valuation changes are recognized under the headings “Interest income” or “Interest expenses”, as appropriate, in the accompanying consolidated income statement (see Note 37).In fair value hedges of interest rate risk of a portfolio of financial instruments (portfolio-hedges), the gains or losses that arise in the measurement of the hedging instrument are recognized in the consolidated income statement, and the gains or losses that arise from the change in the fair value of the hedged item (attributable to the hedged risk) are also recognized in the consolidated income statement (in both cases under the heading “Gains or losses from hedge accounting, net”, using, as a balancing item, the headings “Fair value changes of the hedged items in portfolio hedges of interest rate risk” in the consolidated balance sheets, as applicable.In cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the hedging instruments relating to the effective portion are recognized temporarily under the heading “”Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Hedging derivatives. Cash flow hedges” in the consolidated balance sheets, with a balancing entry under the heading “Hedging derivatives” of the Assets or Liabilities of the Consolidated Financial Statements as applicable. These differences are recognized in the accompanying consolidated income statement at the time when the gain or loss in the hedged instrument affects profit or loss, when the forecast transaction is executed or at the maturity date of the hedged item (See Note 37).Differences in the measurement of the hedging items corresponding to the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are recognized directly in the heading “Gains or (-) losses from hedge accounting, net” in the consolidated income statement (See Note 41).In the hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the differences attributable to the effective portions of hedging items are recognized temporarily under the heading “Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss – Hedging of net investments in foreign transactions” in the consolidated balance sheets with a balancing entry under the heading “Hedging derivatives” of the Assets or Liabilities of the Consolidated Financial Statements as applicable. These differences in valuation are recognized under the heading “Exchange differences (net)” in the consolidated income statement when the investment in a foreign operation is disposed of or derecognized.Other financial instrumentsThe following exceptions are applicable with respect to the above general criteria:Equity instruments whose fair value cannot be determined in a sufficiently objective manner and financial derivatives that have those instruments as their underlying asset and are settled by delivery of those instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at acquisition cost; this may be adjusted, where appropriate, for any impairment loss (see Note 8).Accumulated other comprehensive income arising from financial instruments classified at the consolidated balance sheet date as “Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale” are recognized with the corresponding entry under the heading “Accumulated other comprehensive income- Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss – Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.Impairment losses on financial assetsDefinition of impaired financial assets carried at amortized costA financial asset is considered impaired – and therefore its carrying amount is adjusted to reflect the effect of impairment – when there is objective evidence that events have occurred, which:In the case of debt instruments (loans and advances and debt securities), reduce the future cash flows that were estimated at the time the instruments were acquired. So they are considered impaired when there are reasonable doubts that the carrying amounts will be recovered in full and/or the related interest will be collected for the amounts and on the dates initially agreed.In the case of equity instruments, it means that their carrying amount may not be fully recovered.As a general rule, the carrying amount of impaired financial assets is adjusted with a charge to the consolidated income statement for the period in which the impairment becomes known. The recoveries of previously recognized impairment losses are reflected, if appropriate, in the consolidated income statement for the year in which the impairment is reversed or reduced, with an exception: any recovery of previously recognized impairment losses for an investment in an equity instrument classified as financial assets available for sale is not recognized in the consolidated income statement, but under the heading “ Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Available-for-sale financial assets” in the consolidated balance sheet (see Note 30).In general, amounts collected on impaired loans and receivables are used to recognize the related accrued interest and any excess amount is used to reduce the unpaid principal.When the recovery of any recognized amount is considered remote, such amount is written-off on the consolidated balance sheet, without prejudice to any actions that may be taken in order to collect the amount until the rights extinguish in full either because it is time-barred debt, the debt is forgiven, or other reasons.Impairment on financial assetsThe impairment on financial assets is determined by type of instrument and other circumstances that could affect it, taking into account the guarantees received by the owners of the financial instruments to assure (in part or in full) the performance of the financial assets. The BBVA Group recognizes impairment charges directly against the impaired financial asset when the likelihood of recovery is deemed remote, and uses an offsetting or allowance account when it recognizes non-performing loan provisions for the estimated losses.Impairment of debt securities measured at amortized costWith regard to impairment losses arising from insolvency risk of the obligors (credit risk), a debt instrument, mainly Loans and receivables, is impaired due to insolvency when a deterioration in the ability to pay by the obligor is evidenced, either due to past due status or for other reasons.The BBVA Group has developed policies, methods and procedures to estimate incurred losses on outstanding credit risk. These policies, methods and procedures are applied in the study, approval and execution of debt instruments and Commitments and guarantees given; as well as in identifying the impairment and, where appropriate, in calculating the amounts necessary to cover estimated losses.The amount of impairment losses on debt instruments measured at amortized cost is calculated based on whether the impairment losses are determined individually or collectively. First it is determined whether there is objective evidence of impairment individually for individually significant debt instrument, and collectively for debt instrument that are not individually significant. In the case where the Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment in the case of debt instrument analyzed individually will be included in a group of debt instrument with similar risk characteristics and collectively impaired is analyzed.In determining whether there is objective evidence of impairment the Group uses observable data on the following aspects:Significant financial difficulties of the obligors.Ongoing delays in the payment of interest or principal.Refinancing of credit due to financial difficulties by the counterparty.Bankruptcy or reorganization / liquidation are considered likely.Disappearance of the active market for a financial asset because of financial difficulties.Observable data indicating a reduction in future cash flows from the initial recognition such as adverse changes in the payment status of the counterparty (delays in payments, reaching credit cards limits, etc.)National or local economic conditions that are linked to “defaults” in the financial assets (unemployment rate, falling property prices, etc.).Impairment losses on financial assets individually evaluated for impairmentThe amount of the impairment losses incurred on financial assets represents the excess of their respective carrying amounts over the present values of their expected future cash flows. These cash flows are discounted using the original effective interest rate. If a financial asset has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective rate determined under the contract. As an exception to the rule described above, the market value of listed debt instruments is deemed to be a fair estimate of the present value of their expected future cash flows. The following is to be taken into consideration when estimating the future cash flows of debt instruments:All the amounts that are expected to be recovered over the remaining life of the debt instrument; including, where appropriate, those which may result from the collateral and other credit enhancements provided for the debt instrument (after deducting the costs required for foreclosure and subsequent sale). Impairment losses include an estimate for the possibility of collecting accrued, past-due and uncollected interest.The various types of risk to which each debt instrument is subject.The circumstances in which collections will foreseeably be made.Impairment losses on financial assets collectively evaluated for impairmentImpairment losses on financial assets collectively evaluated for impairment are calculated by using statistical procedures, and they are deemed equivalent to the portion of losses incurred on the date that the accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared that has yet to be allocated to specific asset. The BBVA Group estimates impairment losses through statistical processes that apply historical data and other specific parameters that, although having been generated as of closing date for these consolidated financial statements, have arisen on an individual basis following the reporting date.With respect to financial assets that have no objective evidence of impairment, the Group applies statistical methods using historical experience and other specific information to estimate the losses that the Group has incurred as a result of events that have occurred as of the date of preparation of the consolidated financial statements but have not been known and will be apparent, individually after the date of submission of the information. This calculation is an intermediate step until these losses are identified on an individual level, at which these financial instruments will be segregated from the portfolio of financial assets without objective evidence of impairment.The incurred loss is calculated taking into account three key factors: exposure at default, probability of default and loss given default.Exposure at default (EAD) is the amount of risk exposure at the date of default by the counterparty.Probability of default (PD) is the probability of the counterparty failing to meet its principal and/or interest payment obligations. The PD is associated with the rating/scoring of each counterparty/transaction.Loss given default (LGD) is the estimate of the loss arising in the event of default. It depends mainly on the characteristics of the counterparty, and the valuation of the guarantees or collateral associated with the asset.In order to calculate the LGD at each balance sheet date, the Group evaluates the whole amount expected to be obtained over the remaining life of the financial asset. The recoverable amount from executable secured collateral is estimated based on the property valuation, discounting the necessary adjustments to adequately account for the potential fall in value until its execution and sale, as well as execution costs, maintenance costs and sale costs.In addition, to identify the possible incurred but not reported losses (IBNR) in the unimpaired portfolio, an additional parameter called “LIP” (loss identification period) has to be introduced. The LIP parameter is the period between the time at which the event that generates a given loss occurs and the time when the loss is identified at an individual level. The analysis of the LIPs is carried out on the basis of uniform risk portfolios.When the property right is contractually acquired at the end of the foreclosure process or when the assets of distressed borrowers are purchased, the asset is recognized in the financial statements (see Note 2.2.4).Impairment of other debt instruments classified as financial assets available for saleThe impairment losses on other debt instruments included in the “Available-for-sale financial asset” portfolio are equal to the excess of their acquisition cost (net of any principal repayment), after deducting any impairment loss previously recognized in the consolidated income statement over their fair value.When there is objective evidence that the negative differences arising on measurement of these debt instruments are due to impairment, they are no longer considered as “Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Available-for-sale financial assets” and are recognized in the consolidated income statement.If all, or part of the impairment losses are subsequently recovered, the amount is recognized in the consolidated income statement for the year in which the recovery occurred, up to the amount previously recognized in the income statement.Impairment of equity instrumentsThe amount of the impairment in the equity instruments is determined by the category where they are recognized:Equity instruments classified as available for sale: When there is objective evidence that the negative differences arising on measurement of these equity instruments are due to impairment, they are no longer registered as “Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Available-for-sale financial assets” and are recognized in the consolidated income statement. In general, the Group considers that there is objective evidence of impairment on equity instruments classified as availablefor-sale when significant unrealized losses have existed over a sustained period of time due to a price reduction of at least 40% or over a period of more than 18 months.When applying this evidence of impairment, the Group takes into account the volatility in the price of each individual equity instrument to determine whether it is a percentage that can be recovered through its sale on the market; other different thresholds may exist for certain equity instruments or specific sectors.In addition, for individually significant investments, the Group compares the valuation of the most significant equity instruments against valuations performed by independent experts.Any recovery of previously recognized impairment losses for an investment in an equity instrument classified as available for sale is not recognized in the consolidated income statement, but under the heading “ Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Available-for-sale financial assets” in the consolidated balance sheet (see Note 30).Equity instruments measured at cost: The impairment losses on equity instruments measured at acquisition cost are equal to the excess of their carrying amount over the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the market rate of return for similar equity instruments. In order to determine these impairment losses, save for better evidence, an assessment of the equity of the investee is carried out (excluding Accumulated other comprehensive income due to cash flow hedges) based on the last approved (consolidated) balance sheet, adjusted by the unrealized gains at measurement date.Impairment losses are recognized in the consolidated income statement for the year in which they arise as a direct reduction of the cost of the instrument. These impairment losses may only be recovered subsequently in the event of the sale of these assets.2.2.2 Transfers and derecognition of financial assets and liabilitiesThe accounting treatment of transfers of financial assets is determined by the form in which risks and benefits associated with the financial assets involved are transferred to third parties. Thus the financial assets are only derecognized from the consolidated balance sheet when the cash flows that they generate are extinguished, when their implicit risks and benefits have been substantially transferred to third parties or when the control of financial asset is transferred even with no physical transfer or substantial retention of such assets. In the latter case, the financial asset transferred is derecognized from the consolidated balance sheet, and any right or obligation retained or created as a result of the transfer is simultaneously recognized.Similarly, financial liabilities are derecognized from the consolidated balance sheet only if their obligations are extinguished or acquired (with a view to subsequent cancellation or renewed placement).The Group is considered to have transferred substantially all the risks and benefits if such risks and benefits account for the majority of the risks and benefits involved in ownership of the transferred financial assets. If substantially all the risks and benefits associated with the transferred financial asset are retained:The transferred financial asset is not derecognized from the consolidated balance sheet and continues to be measured using the same criteria as those used before the transfer.A financial liability is recognized at the amount equal to the amount received, which is subsequently measured at amortized cost or fair value with changes in the income statement, whichever the case.Both the income generated on the transferred (but not derecognized) financial asset and the expenses of the new financial liability continue to be recognized.2.2.3 Financial guaranteesFinancial guarantees are considered to be those contracts that require their issuer to make specific payments to reimburse the holder of the financial guarantee for a loss incurred when a specific borrower breaches its payment obligations on the terms – whether original or subsequently modified – of a debt instrument, irrespective of the legal form it may take. Financial guarantees may take the form of a deposit, bank guarantee, insurance contract or credit derivative, among others.In their initial recognition, financial guarantees are recognized as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, which is generally the present value of the fees, commissions and interest receivable from these contracts over the term thereof, and the Group simultaneously recognize a corresponding asset in the consolidated balance sheet for the amount of the fees and commissions received at the inception of the transactions and the amounts receivable at the present value of the fees, commissions and interest outstanding.Financial guarantees, irrespective of the guarantor, instrumentation or other circumstances, are reviewed periodically so as to determine the credit risk to which they are exposed and, if appropriate, to consider whether a provision is required for them. The credit risk is determined by application of criteria similar to those established for quantifying impairment losses on debt instruments measured at amortized cost (see Note 2.2.1).The provisions recognized for financial guarantees considered impaired are recognized under the heading “Provisions - Provisions for contingent risks and commitments” on the liability side in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 24). These provisions are recognized and reversed with a charge or credit, respectively; to “Provisions or reversal of provision” in the consolidated income statements (see Note 46).Income from financial guarantees is recorded under the heading “Fee and commission income” in the consolidated income statement and is calculated by applying the rate established in the related contract to the nominal amount of the guarantee (see Note 40).2.2.4 Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale and liabilities included in disposal groups classified as held for saleThe heading “Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale and liabilities included in disposal groups classified as held for sale” in the consolidated balance sheets includes the carrying amount of assets that are not part of the BBVA Group’s operating activities. The recovery of this carrying amount is expected to take place through the price obtained on its disposal (see Note 21).This heading includes individual items and groups of items (“disposal groups”) and disposal groups that form part of a major operating segment and are being held for sale as part of a disposal plan (“discontinued operations”). The individual items include the assets received by the subsidiaries from their debtors, in full or partial settlement of the debtors’ payment obligations (assets foreclosed or donated in repayment of debt and recovery of lease finance transactions), unless the Group has decided to make continued use of these assets. The BBVA Group has units that specialize in real estate management and the sale of this type of asset.Symmetrically, the heading “Liabilities included in disposal groups classified as held for sale” in the consolidated balance sheets reflects the balances payable arising from disposal groups and discontinued operations. Profit or loss from non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are generally measured, at the acquisition date and at any later date deemed necessary, at either their carrying amount or the fair value of the property (less costs to sell), whichever is lower.In the case of real estate assets foreclosed or received in payment of debts, they are initially recognized at the lower of: the restated carrying amount of the financial asset and the fair value at the time of the foreclosure or receipt of the asset less estimated sales costs. The carrying amount of the financial asset is updated at the time of the foreclosure, treating the real property received as a secured collateral and taking into account the credit risk coverage that would correspond to it according to its classification prior to the delivery. For these purposes, the collateral will be valued at its current fair value (less sale costs) at the time of foreclosure. This carrying amount will be compared with the previous carrying amount and the difference will be recognized as a provision increase, if applicable. On the other hand, the fair value of the foreclosed asset is obtained by appraisal, evaluating the need to apply a discount on the asset derived from the specific conditions of the asset or the market situation for these assets, and in any case, deducting the company’s estimated sale costs.At the time of the initial recognition, these real estate assets foreclosed or received in payment of debts, classified as “Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale and liabilities included in disposal groups classified as held for sale” are valued at the lower of: their restated fair value less estimated sale costs and their carrying amount; a deterioration or impairment reversal can be recognized for the difference if applicable.Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale groups classified as held for sale are not depreciated while included under this heading.Fair value of non-current assets and disposable instruments held for sale from foreclosures or recoveries is based, mainly, in appraisals or valuations made by independent experts on a yearly based or less should there be evidence of impairment. Gains and losses generated on the disposal of assets and liabilities classified as noncurrent held for sale, and liabilities included in disposal groups classified as held for sale as well as impairment losses and, where pertinent, the related recoveries, are recognized in “Profit or (-) loss from non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale not qualifying as discontinued operations” in the consolidated income statement (see Note 50). The remaining income and expense items associated with these assets and liabilities are classified within the relevant consolidated income statement headings.Income and expenses for discontinued operations, whatever their nature, generated during the year, even if they have occurred before their classification as discontinued operations, are presented net of the tax effect as a single amount under the heading “Profit from discontinued operations” in the consolidated income statement, whether the business remains on the balance sheet or is derecognized from the balance sheet. As long as an asset remains in this category, it will not be amortized. This heading includes the earnings from their sale or other disposal.2.2.5 Tangible assetsProperty, plant and equipment for own useThis heading includes the assets under ownership or acquired under lease finance, intended for future or current use by the BBVA Group and that it expects to hold for more than one year. It also includes tangible assets received by the consolidated entities in full or partial settlement of financial assets representing receivables from third parties and those assets expected to be held for continuing use.Property, plant and equipment for own use are presented in the consolidated balance sheets at acquisition cost, less any accumulated depreciation and, where appropriate, any estimated impairment losses resulting from comparing this net carrying amount of each item with its corresponding recoverable amount.Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, on the basis of the acquisition cost of the assets less their residual value; the land on which the buildings and other structures stand is considered to have an indefinite life and is therefore not depreciated.The tangible asset depreciation charges are recognized in the accompanying consolidated income statements under the heading “Depreciation” (see Note 45) and are based on the application of the following depreciation rates (determined on the basis of the average years of estimated useful life of the various assets):Type of AssetsAnnual PercentageBuilding for own use1% - 4%Furniture8% - 10%Fixtures6% - 12%Office supplies and hardware8% - 25%The BBVA Group’s criteria for determining the recoverable amount of these assets, in particular buildings for own use, is based on independent appraisals that are no more than 3-5 years old at most, unless there are indications of impairment.At each reporting date, the Group entities analyze whether there are internal or external indicators that a tangible asset may be impaired. When there is evidence of impairment, the Group analyzes whether this impairment actually exists by comparing the asset’s net carrying amount with its recoverable amount (as the higher between its recoverable amount less disposal costs and its value in use). When the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the carrying amount is written down to the recoverable amount and depreciation charges going forward are adjusted to reflect the asset’s remaining useful life.Similarly, if there is any indication that the value of a tangible asset has been recovered, the consolidated entities will estimate the recoverable amounts of the asset and recognize it in the consolidated income statement, recording the reversal of the impairment loss registered in previous years and thus adjusting future depreciation charges. Under no circumstances may the reversal of an impairment loss on an asset raise its carrying amount above that which it would have if no impairment losses had been recognized in prior years.Running and maintenance expenses relating to tangible assets held for own use are recognized as an expense in the year they are incurred and recognized in the consolidated income statements under the heading “Administration costs - Other administrative expenses - Property, fixtures and equipment” (see Note 44.2).Other assets leased out under an operating leaseThe criteria used to recognize the acquisition cost of assets leased out under operating leases, to calculate their depreciation and their respective estimated useful lives and to recognize the impairment losses on them, are the same as those described in relation to tangible assets for own use.Investment propertiesThe heading “Tangible assets - Investment properties” in the consolidated balance sheets reflects the net values (purchase cost minus the corresponding accumulated depreciation and, if appropriate, estimated impairment losses) of the land, buildings and other structures that are held either to earn rentals or for capital appreciation through sale and that are neither expected to be sold off in the ordinary course of business nor are destined for own use (see Note 17).The criteria used to recognize the acquisition cost of investment properties, calculate their depreciation and their respective estimated useful lives and recognize the impairment losses on them, are the same as those described in relation to tangible assets held for own use.The BBVA Group’s criteria for determining the recoverable amount of these assets is based on independent appraisals that are no more than one year old at most, unless there are indications of impairment.2.2.6 InventoriesThe balance under the heading “Other assets - Inventories” in the consolidated balance sheets mainly includes the land and other properties that the BBVA Group’s real estate entities hold for development and sale as part of their real estate development activities (see Note 20).The cost of inventories includes those costs incurred in during their acquisition and development, as well as other direct and indirect costs incurred in getting them to their current condition and location.In the case of the cost of real-estate assets accounted for as inventories, the cost is comprised of: the acquisition cost of the land, the cost of urban planning and construction, non-recoverable taxes and costs corresponding to construction supervision, coordination and management. Borrowing cost incurred during the year form part of cost, provided that the inventories require more than a year to be in a condition to be sold.Properties purchased from customers in distress, which the Group manages for sale, are measured at the acquisition date and any subsequent time, at either their related carrying amount or the fair value of the property (less costs to sell), whichever is lower. The carrying amount at acquisition date of these properties is defined as the balance pending collection on those assets that originated said purchases (net of provisions).ImpairmentThe amount of any subsequent adjustment due to inventory valuation for reasons such as damage, obsolescence, reduction in sale price to its net realizable value, as well as losses for other reasons and, if appropriate, subsequent recoveries of value up to the limit of the initial cost value, are registered under the heading “ Impairment or (-) reversal of impairment on non-financial assets ” in the accompanying consolidated income statements (see Note 48) for the year in which they are incurred.In the case of real-Estate assets above mentioned, if the fair value less costs to sell is lower than the carrying amount of the loan recognized in the consolidated balance sheet, a loss is recognized under the heading “Impairment or (-) reversal of impairment on non-financial assets” in the consolidated income statement for the period (see Note 48). In the case of real-estate assets accounted for as inventories, the BBVA Group’s criterion for determining their net realizable value is mainly based on independent appraisals no more than one year old, or less if there are indications of impairment.Inventory salesIn sale transactions, the carrying amount of inventories is derecognized from the consolidated balance sheet and recognized as an expense under the income statement heading “Other operating expenses – Changes in inventories” in the year in which the income from its sale is recognized. This income is recognized under the heading “Other operating income – Financial income from non-financial services” in the consolidated income statements (see Note 42).2.2.7 Business combinationsA business combination is a transaction, or any other deal, by which the Group obtains control of one or more businesses. It is accounted for by applying the acquisition method.According to this method, the acquirer has to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, including those that the acquired entity had not recognized in the accounts. The method involves the measurement of the consideration received for the business combination and its allocation to the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities measured according to their fair value, at the purchase date, as well as the recognition of any non-controlling participation (minority interests) that may arise from the transaction.In a business combination achieved in stages, the acquirer shall remeasure its previously held equity interest in the acquiree at its acquisition-date fair value and recognize the resulting gain or loss, if any, in profit or loss under the heading “Gains (losses) on derecognized of non-financial assets and subsidiaries, net” of the Consolidated Income Statements. In prior reporting periods, the acquirer may have recognized changes in the value of its equity interest in the acquiree in other comprehensive income. If so, the amount that was recognized in other comprehensive income shall be recognized on the same basis as would be required if the acquirer had disposed directly of the previously held equity interest.In addition, the acquirer shall recognize an asset in the consolidated balance sheet under the heading “Intangible asset - Goodwill” if on the acquisition date there is a positive difference between:the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of all the non-controlling interests and the fair value of stock previously held in the acquired business; andthe fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.If this difference is negative, it shall be recognized directly in the income statement under the heading “Gain on Bargain Purchase in business combinations”.Non-controlling interests in the acquired entity may be measured in two ways: either at their fair value; or at the proportional percentage of net assets identified in the acquired entity. The method of valuing non-controlling interest may be elected in each business combination. So far, the BBVA Group has always elected for the second method.2.2.8 Intangible assetsGoodwillGoodwill represents a portion of consideration transferred in advance by the acquiring entity for the future economic benefits from assets that cannot be individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is never amortized. It is subject periodically to an impairment analysis, and is written off if it is clear that there has been impairment.Goodwill is assigned to one or more cash-generating units that expect to be the beneficiaries of the synergies derived from the business combinations. The cash-generating units represent the Group’s smallest identifiable asset groups that generate cash flows for the Group and that are largely independent of the flows generated from the Group’s other assets or groups of assets. Each unit or units to which goodwill is allocated:is the lowest level at which the entity manages goodwill internally;is not larger than an operating segment.The cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment (including the allocated goodwill in their carrying amount). This analysis is performed at least annually or more frequently if there is any indication of impairment.For the purpose of determining the impairment of a cash-generating unit to which a part of goodwill has been allocated, the carrying amount of that cash-generating unit, adjusted by the theoretical amount of the goodwill attributable to the non-controlling interests, in the event they are not valued at fair value, is compared with its recoverable amount.The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is equal to the fair value less sale costs and its value in use, whichever is greater. Value in use is calculated as the discounted value of the cash flow projections that the unit’s management estimates and is based on the latest budgets approved for the coming years. The main assumptions used in its calculation are: a sustainable growth rate to extrapolate the cash flows indefinitely, and the discount rate used to discount the cash flows, which is equal to the cost of the capital assigned to each cashgenerating unit, and equivalent to the sum of the risk-free rate plus a risk premium inherent to the cashgenerating unit being evaluated for impairment.Other intangible assetsThese assets may have an indefinite useful life if, based on an analysis of all relevant factors, it is concluded that there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash flows for the consolidated entities. In all other cases they have a finite useful life.Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized according to the duration of this useful life, using methods similar to those used to depreciate tangible assets. The defined useful time intangible asset is made up mainly of IT applications acquisition costs which have a useful life of 3 to 5 years. The depreciation charge of these assets is recognized in the accompanying consolidated income statements under the heading “Depreciation” (see Note 45).The consolidated entities recognize any impairment loss on the carrying amount of these assets with charge to the heading “Impairment or (-) reversal of impairment on non - financial assets- Intangible assets” in the accompanying consolidated income statements (see Note 48). The criteria used to recognize the impairment losses on these assets and, where applicable, the recovery of impairment losses recognized in prior years, are similar to those used for tangible assets.2.2.9 Insurance and reinsurance contractsThe assets of the BBVA Group’s insurance subsidiaries are recognized according to their nature under the corresponding headings of the consolidated balance sheets and the initial recognition and valuation is carried out according to the criteria set out in IFRS 4.The heading “Reinsurance assets” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets includes the amounts that the consolidated insurance subsidiaries are entitled to receive under the reinsurance contracts entered into by them with third parties and, more specifically, the share of the reinsurer in the technical provisions recognized by the consolidated insurance subsidiaries.The heading “Liabilities under insurance contracts” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets includes the technical provisions for direct insurance and inward reinsurance recognized by the consolidated insurance subsidiaries to cover claims arising from insurance contracts in force at period-end (see Note 23).The income or expenses reported by the BBVA Group’s consolidated insurance subsidiaries on their insurance activities is recognized, in accordance with their nature, in the corresponding items of the consolidated income statements.The consolidated insurance entities of the BBVA Group recognize the amounts of the premiums written to the income statement and a charge for the estimated cost of the claims that will be incurred at their final settlement to their consolidated income statements. At the close of each year the amounts collected and unpaid, as well as the costs incurred and unpaid, are accrued. The most significant provisions registered by consolidated insurance entities with respect to insurance policies issued by them are set out by their nature in Note 23.According to the type of product, the provisions may be as follows:Life insurance provisions:Represents the value of the net obligations undertaken with the life insurance policyholder. These provisions include:Provisions for unearned premiums. These are intended for the accrual, at the date of calculation, of the premiums written. Their balance reflects the portion of the premiums received until the closing date that has to be allocated to the period from the closing date to the end of the insurance policy period.Mathematical reserves: Represents the value of the life insurance obligations of the insurance entities at year-end, net of the policyholder’s obligations, arising from life insurance contracted.Non-life insurance provisions:Provisions for unearned premiums. These provisions are intended for the accrual, at the date of calculation, of the premiums written. Their balance reflects the portion of the premiums received until year-end that has to be allocated to the period between the year-end and the end of the policy period.Provisions for unexpired risks: The provision for unexpired risks supplements the provision for unearned premiums by the amount by which that provision is not sufficient to reflect the assessed risks and expenses to be covered by the consolidated insurance subsidiaries in the policy period not elapsed at year-end.Provision for claims:This reflects the total amount of the outstanding obligations arising from claims incurred prior to year-end. Insurance subsidiaries calculate this provision as the difference between the total estimated or certain cost of the claims not yet reported, settled or paid, and the total amounts already paid in relation to these claims.Provision for bonuses and rebates:This provision includes the amount of the bonuses accruing to policyholders, insurees or beneficiaries and the premiums to be returned to policyholders or insurees, as the case may be, based on the behavior of the risk insured, to the extent that such amounts have not been individually assigned to each of them.Technical provisions for reinsurance ceded:Calculated by applying the criteria indicated above for direct insurance, taking account of the assignment conditions established in the reinsurance contracts in force.Other technical provisions:Insurance entities have recognized provisions to cover the probable mismatches in the market reinvestment interest rates with respect to those used in the valuation of the technical provisions.The BBVA Group controls and monitors the exposure of the insurance subsidiaries to financial risk and, to this end, uses internal methods and tools that enable it to measure credit risk and market risk and to establish the limits for these risks.2.2.10 Tax assets and liabilitiesExpenses on corporate income tax applicable to the BBVA Group’s Spanish entities and on similar income taxes applicable to consolidated foreign entities are recognized in the consolidated income statement, except when they result from transactions on which the profits or losses are recognized directly in equity, in which case the related tax effect is also recognized in equity. The total corporate income tax expense is calculated by aggregating the current tax arising from the application of the corresponding tax rate to the tax for the year (after deducting the tax credits or discounts allowable for tax purposes) and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized in the consolidated income statement.Deferred tax assets and liabilities include temporary differences, defined as the amounts to be payable or recoverable in future years arising from the differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases (the “tax value”), and tax loss and tax credit or discount carry forwards (see Note 19).The “Tax Assets” line item in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets includes the amount of all the assets of a tax nature, and distinguishes between: “Current” (amounts recoverable by tax in the next twelve months) and “Deferred” (which includes the amount of tax to be recovered in future years, including those arising from tax losses or credits for deductions or rebates that can be compensated). The “Tax Liabilities” line item in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets includes the amount of all the liabilities of a tax nature, except for provisions for taxes, broken down into: “Current” (income tax payable on taxable profit for the year and other taxes payable in the next twelve months) and “Deferred” (the amount of corporate tax payable in subsequent years).Deferred tax liabilities attributable to taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates or joint venture entities are recognized as such, except where the Group can control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is unlikely that it will reverse in the future. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is considered probable that the consolidated entities will have sufficient taxable profits in the future against which the deferred tax assets can be utilized and are not from the initial recognition (except in the case of a business combination) of other assets or liabilities in a transaction that does not affect the fiscal outcome or the accounting result.The deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized are reassessed by the consolidated entities at each balance sheet date in order to ascertain whether they are still current, and the appropriate adjustments are made on the basis of the findings of the analyses performed. In those circumstances in which it is unclear how a specific requirement of the tax law applies to a particular transaction or circumstance, and the acceptability of the definitive tax treatment depends on the decisions taken by the relevant taxation authority in future, the entity recognizes current and deferred tax liabilities and assets considering whether it is probable or not that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment. Thus, if the entity concludes that it is not probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the entity uses the amount expected to be paid to (recovered from) the taxation authorities.The income and expenses directly recognized in equity that do not increase or decrease taxable income are accounted for as temporary differences.2.2.11 Provisions, contingent assets and contingent liabilitiesThe heading “Provisions” in the consolidated balance sheets includes amounts recognized to cover the BBVA Group’s current obligations arising as a result of past events. These are certain in terms of nature but uncertain in terms of amount and/or settlement date. The settlement of these obligations is deemed likely to entail an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits (see Note 24). The obligations may arise in connection with legal or contractual provisions, valid expectations formed by Group entities relative to third parties in relation to the assumption of certain responsibilities or through virtually certain developments of particular aspects of the regulations applicable to the operation of the entities; and, specifically, future legislation to which the Group will certainly be subject. The provisions are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets when each and every one of the following requirements is met:They represent a current obligation that has arisen from a past event;At the date referred to by the consolidated financial statements, there is more probability that the obligation will have to be met than that it will not;It is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; andThe amount of the obligation can be reasonably estimated.Among other items, these provisions include the commitments made to employees by some of the Group entities (mentioned in Note 2.2.12), as well as provisions for tax and legal litigation.Contingent assets are possible assets that arise from past events and whose existence is conditional on, and will be confirmed only by, the occurrence or non-occurrence of events beyond the control of the Group. Contingent assets are not recognized in the consolidated balance sheet or in the consolidated income statement; however, they will be disclosed, should they exist, in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, provided that it is probable that these assets will give rise to an increase in resources embodying economic benefits.Contingent liabilities are possible obligations of the Group that arise from past events and whose existence is conditional on the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events beyond the control of the Group. They also include the existing obligations of the Group when it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle them; or when, in extremely rare cases, their amount cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the consolidated balance sheet or the income statement (excluding contingent liabilities from business combination) but are reported in the consolidated financial statements.2.2.12 Pensions and other post-employment commitmentsBelow we provide a description of the most significant accounting criteria relating to post-employment and other employee benefit commitments assumed by BBVA Group entities (see Note 25).Short-term employee benefitsBenefits for current active employees which are accrued and settled during the year and for which a provision is not required in the entity´s accounts. These include wages and salaries, social security charges and other personnel expenses.Costs are charged and recognized under the heading “Administration costs – Personnel expenses – Other personnel expenses” of the consolidated income statement (see Note 44.1).Post-employment benefits – Defined-contribution plansThe Group sponsors defined-contribution plans for the majority of its active employees. The amount of these benefits is established as a percentage of remuneration and/or as a fixed amount.The contributions made to these plans in each period by BBVA Group entities are charged and recognized under the heading “Administration costs – Personnel expenses – Defined-contribution plan expense” of the consolidated income statement (see Note 44.1).Post-employment benefits – Defined-benefit plansSome Group entities maintain pension commitments with employees who have already retired or taken early retirement, certain closed groups of active employees still accruing defined benefit pensions, and in-service death and disability benefits provided to most active employees. These commitments are covered by insurance contracts, pension funds and internal provisions.In addition, some of the Spanish entities have offered certain employees the option to retire before their normal retirement age, recognizing the necessary provisions to cover the costs of the associated benefit commitments, which include both the liability for the benefit payments due as well as the contributions payable to external pension funds during the early retirement period.Furthermore, certain Group entities provide welfare and medical benefits which extend beyond the date of retirement of the employees entitled to the benefits.All of these commitments are quantified based on actuarial valuations, with the amounts recorded under the heading “Provisions – Provisions for pensions and similar obligations” and determined as the difference between the value of the defined-benefit commitments and the fair value of plan assets at the date of the consolidated financial statements (see Note 25).Current service cost are charged and recognized under the heading “Administration costs – Personnel expenses – Defined-benefit plan expense” of the consolidated income statement (see Note 44.1).Interest credits/charges relating to these commitments are charged and recognized under the headings “Interest income” and “Interest expense” of the consolidated income statement.Past service costs arising from benefit plan changes as well as early retirements granted during the period are recognized under the heading “Provisions or reversals of provisions” of the consolidated income statement (see Note 46).Other long-term employee benefitsIn addition to the above commitments, certain Group entities provide long service awards to their employees, consisting of monetary amounts or periods of vacation granted upon completion of a number of years of qualifying service.These commitments are quantified based on actuarial valuations and the amounts recorded under the heading “Provisions – Other long-term employee benefits” of the consolidated balance sheet (see Note 24).Valuation of commitments: actuarial assumptions and recognition of gains/lossesThe present value of these commitments is determined based on individual member data. Active employee costs are determined using the “projected unit credit” method, which treats each period of service as giving rise to an additional unit of benefit and values each unit separately. In establishing the actuarial assumptions we taken into account that:They should be unbiased, i.e. neither unduly optimistic nor excessively conservative.They should be mutually compatible and adequately reflect the existing relationship between economic variables such as price inflation, expected wage increases, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets, etc. Future wage and benefit levels should be based on market expectations, at the balance sheet date, for the period over which the obligations are to be settled.The interest rate used to discount benefit commitments is determined by reference to market yields, at the balance sheet date, on high quality bonds.The BBVA Group recognizes actuarial gains/losses relating to early retirement benefits, long service awards and other similar items under the heading “Provisions or reversal of provisions” of the consolidated income statement for the period in which they arise (see Note 46). Actuarial gains/losses relating to pension and medical benefits are directly charged and recognized under the heading “Accumulated other comprehensive income – Items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss – Actuarial gains or (-) losses on defined benefit pension plans” of equity in the consolidated balance sheet (see Note 30).2.2.13 Equity-settled share-based payment transactionsProvided they constitute the delivery of such equity instruments following the completion of a specific period of services, equity-settled share-based payment transactions are recognized as an expense for services being provided by employees, by way of a balancing entry under the heading “Shareholders’ equity – Other equity” in the consolidated balance sheet. These services are measured at fair value for the employees services received, unless such fair value cannot be calculated reliably. In such case, they are measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted, taking into account the date on which the commitments were granted and the terms and other conditions included in the commitments.When the initial compensation agreement includes what may be considered market conditions among its terms, any changes in these conditions will not be reflected in the consolidated income statement, as these have already been accounted for in calculating the initial fair value of the equity instruments. Non-market vesting conditions are not taken into account when estimating the initial fair value of equity instruments, but they are taken into account when determining the number of equity instruments to be issued. This will be recognized on the consolidated income statement with the corresponding increase in total equity.2.2.14 Termination benefitsTermination benefits are recognized in the accounts when the BBVA Group agrees to terminate employment contracts with its employees and has established a detailed plan.2.2.15 Treasury stockThe value of common stock issued by the BBVA Group’s entities and held by them - basically, shares and derivatives on the Bank’s shares held by some consolidated entities that comply with the requirements to be recognized as equity instruments - are recognized as a decrease to net equity, under the heading “Shareholders’ funds - Treasury stock” in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 29).These financial assets are recognized at acquisition cost, and the gains or losses arising on their disposal are credited or debited, as appropriate, to the heading “Shareholders’ funds - Retained earnings” in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 28).2.2.16 Foreign-currency transactions and exchange differencesThe BBVA Group’s functional currency, and thus the currency in which the consolidated financial statements are presented, is the euro. Thus, all balances and transactions denominated in currencies other than the euro are deemed to be denominated in “foreign currency”.Conversion to euros of the balances held in foreign currency is performed in two consecutive stages:Conversion of the foreign currency to the functional currency (currency of the main economic environment in which the entity operates); andConversion to euros of the balances held in the functional currencies of the entities whose functional currency is not the euro.Conversion of the foreign currency to the functional currencyTransactions denominated in foreign currencies carried out by the consolidated entities (or accounted for using the equity method) are initially accounted for in their respective currencies. Subsequently, the monetary balances in foreign currencies are converted to their respective functional currencies using the exchange rate at the close of the financial year. In addition,Non-monetary items valued at their historical cost are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate in force on the purchase date.Non-monetary items valued at their fair value are converted at the exchange rate in force on the date on which such fair value was determined.Income and expenses are converted at the period’s average exchange rates for all the operations carried out during the period. When applying this criterion the BBVA Group considers whether significant variations have taken place in exchange rates during the financial year which, owing to their impact on the statements as a whole, require the application of exchange rates as of the date of the transaction instead of such average exchange rates.The exchange differences produced when converting the balances in foreign currency to the functional currency of the consolidated entities are generally recognized under the heading “Exchange differences (net)” in the consolidated income statements. However, the exchange differences in non-monetary items, measured at fair value, are recognized temporarily in equity under the heading “Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Exchange differences” in the consolidated balance sheets.Conversion of functional currencies to eurosThe balances in the financial statements of consolidated entities whose functional currency is not the euro are converted to euros as follows:Assets and liabilities: at the average spot exchange rates as of the date of each of the consolidated financial statements.Income and expenses and cash flows are converted by applying the exchange rate in force on the date of the transaction, and the average exchange rate for the financial year may be used, unless it has undergone significant variations.Equity items: at the historical exchange rates.The exchange differences arising from the conversion to euros of balances in the functional currencies of the consolidated entities whose functional currency is not the euro are recognized under the heading “Accumulated other comprehensive income – Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Exchange differences” in the consolidated balance sheets. Meanwhile, the differences arising from the conversion to euros of the financial statements of entities accounted for by the equity method are recognized under the heading “ Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Entities accounted for using the equity method” until the item to which they relate is derecognized, at which time they are recognized in the income statement.The breakdown of the main consolidated balances in foreign currencies, with reference to the most significant foreign currencies, is set forth in Appendix VIIVenezuelaLocal financial statements of the Group subsidiaries in Venezuela are expressed in Venezuelan Bolivar, and converted into euros for the consolidated financial statements, as indicated below, since Venezuela is a country with strong exchange restrictions and has different rates officially published:On February 10, 2015, the Venezuelan government announced the creation of a new foreign-currency system called SIMADI.The Group used the SIMADI exchange rate from March 2015 for the conversion of the financial statements of the Group companies located in Venezuela for their consolidated financial statements. The SIMADI exchange rate started to reflect the exchange rate of actual transactions increasing rapidly to approximately 200 Venezuelan bolivars per U,S. dollar (approximately 218 Venezuelan bolivars per euro), however, from May, and during the second half of 2015 the trend was confirmed, the SIMADI exchange rate had hardly fluctuated, reaching as of December 31, 2015 216.3 Venezuelan bolivars per euro, which could be considered unrepresentative of the convertibility of the Venezuelan currency.In February 2016, the Venezuelan government approved a new exchange rate agreement which sets two new mechanisms that regulate the purchase and sale of foreign currency (DIRCOM) and the suspension of the SIMADI exchange rate.As of December 31, 2015 and 2016, the Board of Directors considers that the use of the new exchanges rates and, previously, SIMADI for converting bolivars into euros in preparing the consolidated financial statements does not reflect the true picture of the financial statements of the Group and the financial position of the Group subsidiaries in Venezuela.Consequently, as of December 31, 2015 and 2016, the Group has used in the conversion of the financial statements of these foreign exchange rates amounting to 469 and 1,893 Venezuelan bolivars per euro, respectively. These exchanges rates have been calculated taking into account the estimated evolution of inflation in Venezuela at those dates (170% and 300%, respectively) by the Research Service of the Group (see Note 2.2.20). The summarized balance sheet and income statements of the Group subsidiaries in Venezuela, whose local financial statements are expressed in Venezuelan bolivars comparing their conversion to euros with the estimated exchange rate with the balances that would have result by applying the SIMADI exchange rate, are as follows:Million of EurosBalance sheet December 2016Estimated exchange rateDIRCOMVariationCash and balances with central banks363971608Securities portfolio93248155Loans and recievables5131,371858Tangible assets66177111Other369559TOTAL ASSETS1,0702,8621,791Deposits from central bank and credit institutions253Customer deposits7782,0801,302Provisions215735Other112299187TOTAL LIABILITIES9132,4411,528Download tableIncome statements December 2016Estimated exchange rateDIRCOMVariationNET INTEREST ICOME103275172GROSS INCOME5213987Administration costs5514691NET OPERATING INCOME(3)(7)(5)OPERATING PROFIT BEFORE TAX318251Tax expense or (-) income related to profit or loss from continuing3810063PROFIT(7)(19)(12)Attributable to minority interest (non-controlling interests)(3)(8)(5)Attributable to owners of the parent(4)(10)(6)Download table2.2.17 Recognition of income and expensesTThe most significant criteria used by the BBVA Group to recognize its income and expenses are as follows.Interest income and expenses and similar items:As a general rule, interest income and expenses and similar items are recognized on the basis of their period of accrual using the effective interest rate method. The financial fees and commissions that arise on the arrangement of loans and advances (basically origination and analysis fees) are deferred and recognized in the income statement over the expected life of the loan. The direct costs incurred in originating these loans and advances can be deducted from the amount of financial fees and commissions recognized. These fees are part of the effective interest rate for the loans and advances. Also dividends received from other entities are recognized as income when the consolidated entities’ right to receive them arises.However, when a loan is deemed to be impaired individually or is included in the category of instruments that are impaired because their recovery is considered to be remote, the recognition of accrued interest in the consolidated income statement is discontinued. This interest is recognized for accounting purposes as income, as soon as it is received.Commissions, fees and similar items.Income and expenses relating to commissions and similar fees are recognized in the consolidated income statement using criteria that vary according to the nature of such items. The most significant items in this connection are:Those relating to financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, which are recognized when collected/paid.Those arising from transactions or services that are provided over a period of time, which are recognized over the life of these transactions or services.Those relating to single acts, which are recognized when this single act is carried out.Non-financial income and expenses:These are recognized for accounting purposes on an accrual basis.Deferred collections and payments:These are recognized for accounting purposes at the amount resulting from discounting the expected cash flows at market rates.2.2.18 Sales and income from the provision of non-financial servicesThe heading “Other operating income” in the consolidated income statements includes the proceeds of the sales of assets and income from the services provided by the Group entities that are not financial institutions. In the case of the Group, these entities are mainly real estate and service entities (see Note 42).2.2.19 LeasesLease contracts are classified as finance leases from the inception of the transaction, if they substantially transfer all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset forming the subject-matter of the contract. Leases other than finance leases are classified as operating leases.When the consolidated entities act as the lessor of an asset in finance leases, the aggregate present values of the lease payments receivable from the lessee plus the guaranteed residual value (normally the exercise price of the lessee’s purchase option on expiration of the lease agreement) are recognized as financing provided to third parties and, therefore, are included under the heading “Loans and receivables” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.When the consolidated entities act as lessors of an asset in operating leases, the acquisition cost of the leased assets is recognized under “Tangible assets – Property, plant and equipment – Other assets leased out under an operating lease” in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 17). These assets are depreciated in line with the criteria adopted for items of tangible assets for own use, while the income arising from the lease arrangements is recognized in the consolidated income statements on a straight-line basis within “Other operating expenses” (see Note 42).If a fair value sale and leaseback results in an operating lease, the profit or loss generated from the sale is recognized in the consolidated income statement at the time of sale. If such a transaction gives rise to a finance lease, the corresponding gains or losses are accrued over the lease period.The assets leased out under operating lease contracts to other entities in the Group are treated in the consolidated financial statements as for own use, and thus rental expense and income is eliminated and the corresponding depreciation is recognized.2.2.20 Entities and branches located in countries with hyperinflationary economiesIn order to assess whether an economy is under hyperinflation, the country’s economic environment is evaluated, analyzing whether certain circumstances exist, such as:The country’s population prefers to keep its wealth or savings in non-monetary assets or in a relatively stable foreign currency;Prices may be quoted in a relatively stable foreign currency;Interest rates, wages and prices are linked to a price index;The cumulative inflation rate over three years is approaching, or exceeds, 100%.The fact that any of these circumstances is present will not be a decisive factor in considering an economy hyperinflationary, but it does provide some reasons to consider it as such.Since 2009, the economy of Venezuela can be considered hyperinflationary under the above criteria. As a result, the financial statements of the BBVA Group’s entities located in Venezuela have therefore been adjusted to correct for the effects of inflation in accordance with IAS 29 “ Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies“.The breakdown of the General Price Index and the inflation index used as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 for the inflation restatement of the financial statements of the Group companies located in Venezuela is as follows:General Price Index2016 (*)2015 (**)GPI9,431.602,357.90Average GPI5,847.741,460.50Inflation of the period300%170%Download table(*) As of December 31, 2016, the Venezuelan government had not released the official inflation figures since December 2015, as in the Annual Report of 2015, the group estimated the inflation rate applicable at 300%. (**) At the date of preparation of these consolidated financial statements in 2015, the Venezuelan government had not released the official inflation figures. The Group has estimated the inflation rate applicable to December 31, 2015, based on the best estimate of BBVA Research of the Group (170%) in line with other estimates made by various international organizations. Subsequently, at the publication of the consolidated financial statements, the official inflation figures was published, ending at 180.9%.The losses recognized under the heading “Profit attributable to the parent company” in the accompanying consolidated income statement as a result of the adjustment for inflation on net monetary position of the Group entities in Venezuela amounted to €28 and 45 million in 2016 and 2015 respectively.2.3 Recent IFRS pronouncementsChanges introduced in 2016The following modifications to the IFRS standards or their interpretations (hereinafter “IFRIC”) came into force after January 1, 2016. They have not had a significant impact on the BBVA Group’s consolidated financial statements corresponding to the period ended December 31, 2016.Amended IFRS 11 - “Joint Arrangements”The amendments made to IFRS 11 require the acquirer of an interest in a joint operation in which the activity constitutes a business to apply all of the principles on business combinations accounting in IFRS 3 and other IFRSs. These modifications will be applied to the accounting years starting on or after January 1, 2016, although early adoption is permitted.Amended IAS 16 - “Property, Plant and Equipment” and Amended IAS 38 – “Intangible Assets”.The amendments made to IAS 16 and IAS 38 exclude, as general rule, as depreciation method to be used, those methods based on revenue that is generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset, because the revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset generally reflects factors other than the consumption of the economic benefits of the asset.Amended IAS 27 – “Separate financial statements”Changes to IAS 27 allow entities to use the equity method to account for investment in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, in their separate financial statements.Annual improvements cycle to IFRSs 2012-2014The annual improvements cycle to IFRSs 2012-2014 includes minor changes and clarifications to IFRS 5 – Non current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, IFRS 7 – Financial instruments: Information to disclose, IAS 19 – Employee benefits and IAS 34 – interim financial information.Amended IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial StatementsThe amendments made to IAS 1 further encourage companies to apply professional judgment in determining what information to disclose in their financial statements, in determining when line items are disaggregated and additional headings and subtotals included in the statement of financial position and the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, and in determining where and in what order information is presented in the financial disclosuresAmended IFRS 10 - “Consolidated Financial Statements”, Amended IFRS 12 – “Disclosure of interests in other entities” and Amended IAS 28 – “Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures”The amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 introduce clarifications to the requirements when accounting for investment entities in three aspects:The amendments confirm that a parent entity that is a subsidiary of an investment entity has the possibility to apply the exemption from preparing consolidated financial statementsThe amendments clarify that if an investment entity has a subsidiary whose main purpose is to support the investment entity’s investment activities by providing investment-related services or activities, to the entity or other parties, and that is not itself an investment entity, it shall consolidate that subsidiary; but if that subsidiary is itself an investment entity, the investment entity parent shall measure the subsidiary at fair value through profit or loss.The amendments require a non-investment entity investor to retain, when applying the equity method, the fair value measurement applied by an investment entity associate or joint venture to its interests in subsidiaries.Standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective as of December 31, 2016New International Financial Reporting Standards together with their interpretations had been published at the date of preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, but are not obligatory as of December 31, 2016. Although in some cases the IASB permits early adoption before they come into force, the BBVA Group has not done so as of this date, as it is still analyzing the effects that will result from them.IFRS 9 - “Financial instruments”As of July, 24, 2014, IASB issued the IFRS 9 which will replace IAS 39 and includes a new classification and assessment requirements of financial assets and liabilities, impairment requirements of financial assets and hedge accounting policy.Classification and assessment of financial assets and liabilitieThe classification of financial assets will depend on the company’s business model used for management purposes and the characteristics of the contractual cash flows, resulting in the measurement of such financial assets at amortized cost, fair value with changes in other comprehensive income and liabilities not measured at fair value through profit or loss, net.The combined effect of applying the company’s business model and the characteristics of the contractual cash flows may result in differences in the stock of financial assets measured at amortized cost or at fair value compared to IAS 39, although the Group does not expect significant changes in this regard.With regard to financial liabilities, the classification categories proposed by IFRS 9 are similar to those contained in IAS 39, so there should not be very significant differences save for the requirement to recognize changes in fair value related to own credit risk as a component of equity, in the case of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss.Financial assets impairmentsImpairment requirements will apply to financial assets measured at amortized cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income, and to lease receivables and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.At initial recognition, an allowance is required for expected credit losses resulting from default events that may occur within the next 12 months (“12 month expected credit losses”). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, an allowance is required for expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (“lifetime expected credit losses”).The assessment of whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition should be performed for each reporting period by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The assessment of credit risk, and the estimation of expected credit losses, should be performed so that they are probability-weighted and unbiased and shall include all available information that is relevant to the assessment, including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable expectations of future events and economic conditions at the reporting date.As a result, the goal is for the recognition and measurement of impairment to be more proactive and forward-looking than under the current incurred loss model of IAS 39.Theoretically, an increase in the total level of impairment allowances is expected, since all financial assets will be assessed for at least 12 month expected credit losses and the population of financial assets to which lifetime expected credit losses will be applied is expected to be larger than the population for which there is objective evidence of impairment under IAS 39Hedge accountingIFRS 9 will also affect hedge accounting, because the focus of the Standard is different from that of the current IAS 39, as it tries to align the accounting requirements with economic risk management. IFRS 9 will also permit to apply hedge accounting to a wider range of risks and hedging instruments. The Standard does not address the accounting for the macro hedging strategies. To avoid any conflict between the current macro hedge accounting and the new general hedge accounting requirements, IFRS 9 includes an accounting policy choice to continue applying hedge accounting according to IAS 39.The IASB has established January 1, 2018, as the mandatory application date, with the possibility of early adoption.During 2015 and 2016, the Group has been analyzing this new Standard and the implications it will have in 2018 on the classification of portfolios and the valuation models for financial instruments, focusing on impairment loss models for financial assets through expected loss models.In 2017, the Group will continue working on the definition of accounting policies, on the implementation of the Standard, which has implications both on the financial statements and on the Group´s daily operations (initial and subsequent risk assessment, changes in systems, management metrics, etc.), and also on the models used for the presentation of financial statements.As of the date of preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements, the Group does not have an estimation of the quantitative impact that this Standard will have on January 1, 2018 when it will come into force. The Group expects to have a parallel calculation during 2017 in order to have comparative information for the previous year when the Standard comes into effect.Amended IFRS 7 - “Financial instruments: Disclosures”The IASB modified IFRS 7 in December 2011 to include new disclosures on financial instruments that entities will have to provide as soon as they apply IFRS 9 for the first time.IFRS 15 - “Revenue from contracts with customers”IFRS 15 contains the principles that an entity shall apply to account for revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer.The core principle of IFRS 15 is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, in accordance with contractually agreed. It is considered that the good or service is transferred when the customer obtains control over it.The new Standard replaces IAS 18 - Revenue IAS 11 - Construction Contracts, IFRIC 13 - Customer Loyalty Programmes, IFRIC 15 - Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate, IFRIC 18 - Transfers of Assets from Customers and SIC 31 – Revenue-Transactions Involving Advertising ServicesThis Standard will be applied to the accounting years starting on or after January 1, 2018, although early adoption is permitted.IFRS 15 – “Clarifications to IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers”The amendments to the Revenue Standard clarify how some of the underlying principles of the new Standard should be applied. Specifically, they clarify how to:Identify a performance obligation (the promise to transfer a good or a service to a customer) in a contract;Determine whether a company is a principal (the provider of a good or service) or an agent (responsible for arranging for the good or service to be provided); andDetermine whether the revenue from granting a license should be recognized at a point in time or over time.In addition to the clarifications, the amendments include two additional reliefs to reduce cost and complexity for a company when it first applies the new Standard. The amendments will be applied at the same time as the IFRS 15, i.e. to the accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, although early application is permitted.Amended IFRS 10 – “Consolidated financial statements” and Amended IAS 28 - “Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures”The amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 establish that when an entity sells or transfers assets are considered a business (including its consolidated subsidiaries) to an associate or joint venture of the entity, the latter will have to recognize any gains or losses derived from such transaction in its entirety. Notwithstanding, if the assets sold or transferred are not considered a business, the entity will have to recognize the gains or losses derived only to the extent of the interests in the associate or joint venture with unrelated investors.These changes will be applicable to accounting periods beginning on the effective date, still to be determined, although early adoption is allowed.IAS 12 – “Income Taxes. Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealized Losses”The amendments made to IAS 12 clarify the requirements on recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealized losses on debt instruments measured at fair value. The following aspects are clarified:An unrealized loss on a debt instrument measured at fair value gives rise to a deductible temporary difference regardless of whether the holder expects to recover its carrying amount by holding the debt instrument until maturity or by selling the debt instrument.An entity assesses the utilization of deductible temporary differences in combination with other deductible temporary differences. In circumstances in which tax laws restricts the utilization of tax losses, an entity would assess a deferred tax asset in combination with other deferred tax assets of the appropriate type.An entity’s estimate of future taxable profit can include amounts from recovering assets for more than their carrying amounts if there is sufficient evidence to conclude that it is probable that the entity will achieve this.An entity’s estimate of future taxable profit excludes tax deductions resulting from the reversal of deductible temporary difference.These modifications will be applied to the accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017, although early application is permitted.IFRS 16 – “Leases”On January 13, 2016 the IASB issued the IFRS 16 which will replace IAS 17. The new standard introduces a single lessee accounting model and will require a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. A lessee will be required to recognize a right-of–use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.With regard to lessor accounting, IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor will continue to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases, and account for those two types of leases differently.The standard will be applied to the accounting years starting on or after January 1, 2019, although early application is permitted if IFRS 15 is also applied.IAS 7 – “Statement of Cash Flows. Disclosure Initiative”The amendments to IAS 7 introduce the following new disclosure requirements related to changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, to the extent necessary to enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in those liabilities: changes from financing cash flows; changes arising from obtaining or losing control of subsidiaries or other businesses; the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates; changes in fair values; and other changes.Liabilities arising from financing activities are liabilities for which cash flows were, or future cash flows will be, classified in the statement of cash flows as cash flows arising from financing activities. Additionally, the disclosure requirements also apply to changes in financial assets if cash flows from those financial assets were, or future cash flows will be, included in cash flows from financing activities.These modifications will be applied to the accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017, although early application is permitted.IFRS 2 – “Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions”The amendments made to IFRS 2 provide requirements on three different aspects:When measuring the fair value of a cash-settled share-based payment vesting conditions, other than market conditions, shall be taken into account by adjusting the number of awards included in the measurement of the liability arising from the transaction.A transaction in which an entity settles a share-base payment arrangement net by withholding a specified portion of the equity instruments to meet a statutory tax withholding obligation will be classified as equity settled in its entirety if, without the net settlement feature, the entire share-based payment would otherwise be classified as equity-settled.In case of modification of a share-based payment from cash-settled to equity-settled, the modification will be accounted for derecognizing the original liability and recognizing in equity the fair value of the equity instruments granted to the extent that services have been rendered up to the modification date; any difference will be recognized immediately in profit or lossThese modifications will be applied to the accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, although early application is permitted.Amended IFRS 4 “Insurance Contracts”The amendments made to IFRS 4 address the temporary accounting consequences of the different effective dates of IFRS 9 and the forthcoming insurance contracts Standard, by introducing two optional solutions:The deferral approach or temporary exemption, that gives entities whose predominant activities are connected with insurance the option to defer the application of IFRS 9 and continue applying IAS 39 until 2021.The overlay approach, that gives all issuers of insurance contracts the option to recognize in other comprehensive income, rather than profit or loss, the additional accounting volatility that may arise from applying IFRS 9 compared to applying IAS 39 before applying the forthcoming insurance contracts Standard.These modifications will be applied to the accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, although early application is permitted.Annual improvements cycle to IFRSs 2014-2016The annual improvements cycle to IFRSs 2014-2016 includes minor changes and clarifications to IFRS 1- Fristtime Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS 12 – Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and IAS 28 – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.Amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 28 will be applied to the accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, although early application is permitted to amendments to IAS 28. Amendments to IFRS 12 will be applied to the accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017.IFRIC 22- Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance ConsiderationThe Interpretation addresses how to determine the date of the transaction, and thus, the exchange rate to use to translate the related asset, expense or income on initial recognition, in circumstances in which a non-monetary prepayment asset or a non-monetary deferred income liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration is recognized in advance of the related asset, income or expense. It requires that the date of the transaction will be the date on which an entity initially recognizes the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability.If there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, the entity shall determine a date of the transaction for each payment or receipt of advance consideration.The interpretation will be applied to the accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, although early application is permittedAmended IAS 40 – Investment PropertyThe amendment states that an entity shall transfer a property to, or from, investment property when, and only when, there is evidence of a change in use. A change in use occurs when the property meets, or ceases to meet, the definition of investment property.The amendments will be applied to the accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, although early adoption is allowed.3.

It has a representative office in Sao Paulo (Brazil).The Group owns more than 50% of most of the entities based in these countries. Appendix I shows a list of the entities which, although less than 50% owned by the BBVA Group as of December 31, 2016, are consolidated (see Note 2.1).The United States The Group’s activity in the United States is mainly carried out through a group of entities with BBVA Compass Bancshares, Inc. at their head, the New York BBVA branch and a representative office in Silicon Valley (California).Turkey The Group’s activity in Turkey is mainly carried out through the Garanti Group.Rest of Europe The Group’s activity in Europe is carried out through banks and financial institutions in Ireland, Switzerland, Italy, Netherlands, Romania and Portugal, branches in Germany, Belgium, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, and a representative office in Moscow.Asia-Pacific The Group’s activity in this region is carried out through branches (in Taipei, Seoul, Tokyo, Hong Kong Singapore and Shanghai) and representative offices (in Beijing, Mumbai, Abu Dhabi, Sydney and Jakarta).Changes in the Group in 2016MergersThe BBVA Group, at its Board of Directors meeting held on March 31, 2016, adopted a resolution to begin a merger process of BBVA S.A. (absorbing company), Catalunya Banc, S.A., Banco Depositario BBVA, S.A. y Unoe Bank, S.A.This transaction is part of the corporate reorganization of its banking subsidiaries in Spain and has been successfully completed throughout 2016 and has no impact in the consolidated financial statements both from the accounting and the solvency stand points.Changes in the Group in 2015During 2015, it was registered the full consolidation of Garanti since the date of effective control (third quarter) and the acquisition of Catalunya Banc (second quarter). These effects impact on the period-on-period comparison of all the income statements was affected with the previous first semester results.InvestmentsAcquisition of an additional 14.89% of GarantiOn November 19, 2014, the Group signed a new agreement with Dogus Holding AS, Ferit Faik Sahenk, Dianne Sahenk and Defne Sahenk (hereinafter “Dogus”) to, among other terms, the acquisition of 62,538,000,000 additional shares of Garanti (equivalent to 14.89% of the capital of this entity) for a maximum total consideration of 8,90 Turkish lira per batch (Garanti traded in batches of 100 shares each).In the same agreement stated that if the payment of dividends for the year 2014 was executed by Dogus before the closing of the acquisition, that amount would be deducted from the amount payable by BBVA. On April 27, 2015, Dogus received the amount of the dividend paid to shareholders of Garanti, which amounted to Turkish Liras 0,135 per batch.On July 27, 2015, after obtaining all the required regulatory approvals, the Group has materialized said participation increase after the acquisition of the new shares. Now the Group’s interest in Garanti is 39.9%.The total price effectively paid by BBVA amounts to 8,765 TL per batch (amounting to approximately TL 5,481 million and €1,857 million applying a 2.9571 TL/EUR exchange rate).In accordance with the EU-IFRS accounting rules, and as a consequence of the agreements reached, the BBVA Group shall, at the date of effective control, measure at fair value its previously acquired stake of 25,01% in Garanti (classified as a joint venture accounted for using the equity method) and shall consolidate Garanti in the consolidated financial statements of the BBVA Group, beginning on the above-mentioned effective control date.Measuring the above-mentioned stake in Garanti Bank at fair value resulted in a negative impact in “Gains or (-) losses on derecognition of non-financial assets and subsidiaries, net” in the consolidated income statement of the BBVA Group for the second semester of 2015, which resulted in a net negative impact in the Profit attributable to owners of the parent of the BBVA Group in 2015 amounting to €1.840 million. Such accounting impact does not translate into any additional cash outflow from BBVA. Most of this impact is generated by the exchange rate differences due to the depreciation of the TL against Euro since the initial acquisition by BBVA of the 25,01% stake in Garanti Bank up to the date of effective control. As of December 31, 2015, these exchange rate differences were already registered as Other Comprehensive Income deducting the stock shareholder’s equity of the BBVA Group.The agreements with the Dogus group include an agreement for the management of the bank and the appointment by the BBVA Group of the majority of the members of its Board of Directors (7 of 10). The 39.9% stake in Garanti is consolidated in the BBVA Group, because of these management agreements.The Group estimate according to the acquisition method, the comparison between the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from Garanti, along with the identified intangible assets, and cash payment made by the BBVA Group in consideration of the transaction generated a goodwill of €624 million (at exchange rate of December 31.2016), which is registered under the heading “Intangible assets - Goodwill” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 (see Note 18.1)Acquisition of Catalunya BancOn July 21, 2014, the Management Commission of the Banking Restructuring Fund (known as “FROB”) accepted BBVA´s bid in the competitive auction for the acquisition of Catalunya Banc, S.A. (“Catalunya Banc”).On April 24, 2015, once the necessary authorizations have been obtained and all the agreed conditions precedent have been fulfilled, BBVA announced that it acquired 1,947,166,809 shares of Catalunya Banc, S.A. (approximately 98.4% of its share capital) for a price of approximately €1,165 million.According to the purchase method, the comparison between the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from Catalunya Banc, and the cash payment made to the FROB in consideration of the transaction generated a difference of €26 million, which is registered under the heading “Negative goodwill recognized in profit or loss” in the accompanying consolidated income statement as of December 31, 2015. According to the IFRS 3, there is a period, up to a year, to complete the necessary adjustments to the calculation of initial acquisition (see Note 18.1). After the deadline, there has not been any significant adjustment that involves amending the calculation recorded in the year 2015.DivestituresPartial sale of China CITIC Bank Corporation Limited (CNCB)On January 23, 2015 the Group BBVA signed an agreement to sell 4.9% in China CITIC Bank Corporation Limited (CNCB) to UBS AG, London Branch (UBS), who entered into transactions pursuant to which such CNCB shares will be transferred to a third party and the ultimate economic benefit of ownership of such CNCB shares will be transferred to Xinhu Zhongbao Co., Ltd (Xinhu) (the Relevant Transactions).

Earnings per shareBasic and diluted earnings per share are calculated in accordance with the criteria established by IAS 33. For more information see Glossary of terms.The Bank issued additional share capital in 2016, 2015 and 2014 (see “Dividend Option” Program in 2015 in Note 26). In accordance with IAS 33, when events, other than the conversion of potential shares, have changed the number of shares outstanding without a corresponding change in resources, the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period and for all the periods presented shall be adjusted. The prior year weighted average number of shares is adjusted by applying a corrective factor.The calculation of earnings per share is as follows:Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share20162015 (*)2014 (*)Numerator for basic and diluted earnings per share (millions of euros)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Profit attributable to parent company 3,4752,6422,618Adjustment: Additional Tier 1 securities (1)(260)(212)(126) Profit adjusted (millions of euros) (A)3,2152,4302,492Profit from discontinued operations (net of non-controlling interest) (B)---Denominator for basic earnings per share (number of shares outstanding):&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Weighted average number of shares outstanding (2)6,4686,2905,908Weighted average number of shares outstanding x corrective factor (3)6,4686,5176,278Adjusted number of shares - Basic earning per share (C)6,4686,5176,278Adjusted number of shares - diluted earning per share(D)6,4686,5176,278Earnings per share0.500.370.40Basic earnings per share from continued operations (Euros per share)A-B/C0.500.370.40Diluted earnings per share from continued operations (Euros per share)A-B/D0.500.370.40Basic earnings per share from discontinued operations (Euros per share)B/C---Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations (Euros per share)B/D---Download table(1) Remuneration in the period related to contingent convertible securities, recognized in equity (see Note 22.3).

Risk management7.1 General risk management and control modelThe BBVA Group has an overall risk management and control model (hereinafter ‘the model’) tailored to their individual business, their organization and the geographies in which they operate, allowing them to develop their activity in accordance with their strategy and policy control and risk management defined by the governing bodies of the Bank and adapt to a changing economic and regulatory environment, tackling risk management globally and adapted to the circumstances of each instance. The model establishes a system of appropriate risk management regarding risk profile and strategy of the Group. This model is applied comprehensively in the Group and consists of the basic elements listed below:Governance and organization.Risk appetite framework.Decisions and processes.Assessment, monitoring and reporting.Infrastructure.The Group encourages the development of a risk culture to ensure consistent application of the control and risk management Model in the Group, and to ensure that the risk function is understood and assimilated at all levels of the organization.7.1.1 Governance and organizationThe governance model for risk management at BBVA is characterized by a special involvement of its corporate bodies, both in setting the risk strategy and in the ongoing monitoring and supervision of its implementation.Thus, as developed below, the corporate bodies are the ones that approve this risk strategy and corporate policies for the different types of risk, being the risk function responsible for the management, its implementation and development, reporting to the governing bodies.The responsibility for the daily management of the risks lies on the businesses which abide in the development of their activity to the policies, standards, procedures, infrastructure and controls, based on the framework set by the governing bodies, which are defined by the function risk.To perform this task properly, the risk function in the BBVA Group is configured as a single, comprehensive and independent role of commercial areas.Corporate governance systemBBVA Group has developed a corporate governance system that is in line with the best international practices and adapted to the requirements of the regulators in the countries in which its various business units operate.The Board of Directors (hereinafter also referred to as “the Board”) approves the risk strategy and oversees the internal management and control systems. Specifically, in relation to the risk strategy, the Board approves the Group’s risk appetite statement, the core metrics (and their statements) and the main metrics by type of risk (and their statements), as well as the general risk management and control model.The Board of Directors is also responsible for approving and monitoring the strategic and business plan, the annual budgets and management goals, as well as the investment and funding policy, in a consistent way and in line with the approved Risk Appetite Framework. For this reason, the processes for defining the Risk Appetite Framework proposals and strategic and budgetary planning at Group level are coordinated by the executive area for submission to the Board.With the aim of ensuring the integration of the Risk Appetite Framework into management, on the basis established by the Board of Directors, the Executive Committee approves the metrics by type of risk in relation to concentration, profitability and reputational risk and the Group’s basic structure of limits at geographical area, risk type, asset type and portfolio level. This Committee also approves specific corporate policies for each type of risk.Lastly, the Board has set up a Board committee focus in risks, the Risk Committee, that assists the Board and the Executive Committee in determining the Group’s risk strategy and the risk limits and policies, respectively, analyzing and assessing beforehand the proposals submitted to those bodies. The amendment of the Group’s risk strategy and of its elements is the exclusive power of the BBVA Board of Directors, while the Executive Committee is responsible for amending the metrics by type of risk within its scope of decision and the Group’s basic structure of limits, when applicable. In both cases, the amendments follow the same decision-making process described above, so the proposals for amendment are submitted by the Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) and later analyzed, first by the Risks Committee, for later submission to the Board of Directors or to the Executive Committee, as appropriate.Moreover, the Risks Committee, the Executive Committee and the Board itself conduct proper monitoring of the risk strategy implementation and of the Group’s risk profile. The risks function regularly reports on the development of the Group’s Risk Appetite Framework metrics to the Board and to the Executive Committee, after their analysis by the Risks Committee, whose role in this monitoring and control work is particularly relevant.The head of the risk function in the executive hierarchy is the Group’s CRO, who carries out its functions with independence, authority, rank, experience, knowledge and resources to do so. He is appointed by the Board of the Bank as a member of its Senior Management, and has direct access to its corporate bodies (Board, Executive Standing Committee and Risk Committee), who reports regularly on the status of risks to the Group.The CRO, for the utmost performance of its functions, is supported by a cross composed set of units in corporate risk and the specific risk units in the geographical and / or business areas of the Group structure. Each of these units is headed by a Risk Officer for the geographical and/or business area who, within his/her field of competence, carries out risk management and control functions and is responsible for applying the corporate policies and rules approved at Group level in a consistent manner, adapting them if necessary to local requirements and reporting to the local corporate bodies.The Risk Officers of the geographical and/or business areas report both to the Group’s CRO and to the head of their geographical and/or business area. This dual reporting system aims to ensure that the local risk management function is independent from the operating functions and that it is aligned with the Group’s corporate risk policies and goals.Organizational structure and committeesThe risk management function, as defined above, consists of risk units from the corporate area, which carry out cross-cutting functions, and risk units from the geographical and/or business areas.The corporate area’s risk units develop and present the Group’s risk appetite proposal, corporate policies, rules and global procedures and infrastructures to the CRO, within the action framework approved by the corporate bodies, ensure their application, and report either directly or through the CRO to the Bank’s corporate bodies. Their functions includeManagement of the different types of risks at Group level in accordance with the strategy defined by the corporate bodies.Risk planning aligned with the risk appetite framework principles defined by the Group.Monitoring and control of the Group’s risk profile in relation to the risk appetite framework approved by the Bank’s corporate bodies, providing accurate and reliable information with the required frequency and in the necessary format.Prospective analyses to enable an evaluation of compliance with the risk appetite framework in stress scenarios and the analysis of risk mitigation mechanisms.Management of the technological and methodological developments required for implementing the Model in the Group.Design of the Group’s Internal Control model and definition of the methodology, corporate criteria and procedures for identifying and prioritizing the risk inherent in each unit’s activities and processes.Validation of the models used and the results obtained by them in order to verify their adaptation to the different uses to which they are applied.The risk units in the business units develop and present to the Risk Officer of the geographical and/or business area the risk appetite framework proposal applicable in each geographical and/or business area, independently and always within the Group’s strategy/risk appetite framework. They also ensure that the corporate policies and rules approved consistently at a Group level are applied, adapting them if necessary to local requirements; they are provided with appropriate infrastructures for management and control of their risks, within the global risk infrastructure framework defined by the corporate areas; and they report to their corporate bodies and/or to senior management, as appropriate.The local risk units thus work with the corporate area risk units in order to adapt to the risk strategy at Group level and share all the information necessary for monitoring the development of their risks.The risk function has a decision-making process to perform its functions, underpinned by a structure of committees, where the Global Risk Management Committee (GRMC) acts as the highest committee within Risk. It proposes, examines and, where applicable, approves, among others, the internal risk regulatory framework and the procedures and infrastructures needed to identify, assess, measure and manage the material risks faced by the Group in its businesses, the determination of risk limits by portfolio or counterparty; and the admission of the operations involving the most relevant risks. The members of this Committee are the Group’s CRO and the heads of the risk units of the corporate area and of the most representative geographical and/or business areas.The GRMC carries out its functions assisted by various support committees which include:Global Technical Operations Committee: It is responsible for analyzing and decision-making related to wholesale credit risk admission in certain customer segments.Monitoring, Assessment &amp;amp; Reporting Committee: It guarantees and ensures the appropriate development of aspects related to risk identification, assessment, monitoring and reporting, with an integrated and crosscutting vision.Asset Allocation Committee: The executive body responsible for analysis and decision-making on all credit risk matters related to the processes intended for obtaining a balance between risk and return.Technology &amp;amp; Analytics Committee: It ensures an appropriate decision-making process regarding the development, implementation and use of the tools and models required to achieve an appropriate management of those risks to which the BBVA Group is exposed.Corporate Technological Risks and Operational Control Committee: It approves the Technological Risks and Operational Control Management Frameworks in accordance with the General Risk Management Model’s architecture and monitors metrics, risk profiles and operational loss events.Global Markets Risk Unit Global Committee: It is responsible for formalizing, supervising and communicating the monitoring of trading desk risk in all the Global Markets business units, as well as coordinating and approving GMRU key decisions activity, and developing and proposing to GRMC the corporate regulation of the unit.Corporate Operational and Outsourcing Risk Admission Committee: It identifies and assesses the operational risks of new businesses, new products and services, and outsourcing initiatives.Retail Risk Committee: It ensures the alignment of the practices and processes of the retail credit risk cycle with the approved risk tolerance and with the business growth and development objectives established in the corporate strategy of the GroupEach geographical and/or business area has its own risk management committee (or committees), with objectives and contents similar to those of the corporate area, which perform their duties consistently and in line with corporate risk policies and rules.Under this organizational scheme, the risk management function ensures the risk strategy, the regulatory framework, and standardized risk infrastructures and controls are integrated and applied across the entire Group. It also benefits from the knowledge and proximity to customers in each geographical and/or business area, and transmits the corporate risk culture to the Group’s different levels. Moreover, this organization enables the risks function to conduct and report to the corporate bodies integrated monitoring and control of the entire Group’s risks.Internal Risk Control and Internal ValidationThe Group has a specific Internal Risk Control unit whose main function is to ensure there is an adequate internal regulatory framework in place, together with a process and measures defined for each type of risk identified in the Group, (and for other types of risk that could potentially affect the Group, to oversee their application and operation, and to ensure that the risk strategy is integrated into the Group’s management. The Internal Risk Control unit verifies the performance of their duties by the units that develop the risk models, manage the processes and execute the controls. Its scope is global both geographically and in terms of type of risk.The Director of Group Internal Control Risk is responsible for the function, and reports its activities and work plans to the CRO and the Risk Committee of the Board, besides attending to it on issues deemed necessary.For these purposes the Internal Risks Control department has a Technical Secretary’s Office, which offers the Committee the technical support it needs to better perform its duties.The unit has a structure of teams at both corporate level and in the most relevant geographical areas in which the Group operates. As in the case of the corporate area, local units are independent of the business areas that execute the processes, and of the units that execute the controls. They report functionally to the Internal Risk Control unit. This unit’s lines of action are established at Group level, and it is responsible for adapting and executing them locally, as well as for reporting the most relevant aspects.Additionally, the Group has an Internal Validation unit, which reviews the performance of its duties by the units that develop risk models and of those who use them to manage. Its functions include, among others, review and independent validation, internally, of the models used for the control and management of the Group’s risks.7.1.2 Risk appetite frameworkThe Group’s risk appetite framework, approved by the Board, determines the risks (and their level) that the Group is willing to assume to achieve its business objectives considering an organic evolution of its business. These are expressed in terms of solvency, liquidity and funding profitability, recurrent earnings, cost of risk or other metrics, which are reviewed periodically as well as in case of material changes to the entity’s business or relevant corporate transactions.. The definition of the risk appetite has the following goals:To express the maximum levels of risk it is willing to assume, at both Group and geographical and/or business area level.To establish a set of guidelines for action and a management framework for the medium and long term that prevent actions from being taken (at both Group and geographical and/or business area level) that could compromise the future viability of the Group.To establish a framework for relations with the geographical and/or business areas that, while preserving their decision-making autonomy, ensures they act consistently, avoiding uneven behavior.To establish a common language throughout the organization and develop a compliance-oriented risk culture.Alignment with the new regulatory requirements, facilitating communication with regulators, investors and other stakeholders, thanks to an integrated and stable risk management framework.Risk appetite framework is expressed through the following elements:Risk appetite statementSets out the general principles of the Group’s risk strategy and the target risk profile. The Group’s Risk appetite statement is:BBVA Group’s risk policy is designed to achieve a moderate risk profile for the entity, through: prudent management and a responsible universal banking business model targeted to value creation, risk-adjusted return and recurrence of results; diversified by geography, asset class, portfolio and clients; and with presence in emerging and developed countries, maintaining a medium/low risk profile in every country, and focusing on a long term relationship with the client.Core metrics and statementsBased on the risk appetite statement, statements are established to set down the general risk management principles in terms of solvency, profitability, liquidity and funding.Solvency: a sound capital position, maintaining resilient capital buffer from regulatory and internal requirements that supports the regular development of banking activity even under stress situations. As a result, BBVA proactively manages its capital position, which is tested under different stress scenarios from a regular basis.Liquidity and funding: A sound balance-sheet structure to sustain the business model. Maintenance of an adequate volume of stable resources, a diversified wholesale funding structure, which limits the weight of short term funding and ensures the access to the different funding markets, optimizing the costs and preserving a cushion of liquid assets to overcome a liquidity survival period under stress scenarios.Income recurrence and profitability: A sound margin-generation capacity supported by a recurrent business model based on the diversification of assets, a stable funding and a customer focus; combined with a moderate risk profile that limits the credit losses even under stress situations; all focused on allowing income stability and maximizing the risk-adjusted profitability.In addition, the core metrics define, in quantitative terms, the principles and the target risk profile set out in the risk appetite statement and are in line with the strategy of the Group. Each metric have three thresholds (trafficlight approach) ranging from a standard business management to higher deterioration levels: Management reference, Maximum appetite and Maximum capacity. The Group’s Core metrics are:MetricSolvencyEconomic Solvency&amp;nbsp;Regulatory Solvency: CET1 Fully LoadedLiquidity and FundingLoan to Stable Costumer Deposits (LTSCD)&amp;nbsp;Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)Income recurrence and profitabilityNet margin / Average Total Assets&amp;nbsp;Cost of Risk&amp;nbsp;Return on Equity (ROE)Download tableBy type of risk metrics and statementsBased on the core metrics, statements are established for each type of risk reflecting the main principles governing the management of that risk and several metrics are calibrated, compliance with which enables compliance with the core metrics and the statement of the Group. By type of risk metrics define the strategic positioning per type of risk and have a maximum appetite level.Basic limits structure (core limits)The purpose of the basic limits structure or core limits is to manage risks on an ongoing basis within the thresholds tolerated by core and “by type of risk” metrics; so they are a breakdown by geography and portfolio of the same metrics or complementary metrics.In addition to this framework, there’s a Management limits level that is defined and managed by the Risk Area developing the core limits, in order to ensure that the early management of risks by subcategories or by subportfolios complies with that core limits and, in general, with the risk appetite framework.The following graphic summarizes the structure of BBVA’s Risk appetite framework:The corporate risk area works with the various geographical and/or business areas to define their risk appetite framework, which will be coordinated with and integrated into the Group’s risk appetite to ensure that its profile fits as defined.The risk appetite framework defined by the Group expresses the levels and types of risk that the Bank is willing to assume to be able to implement its strategic plan with no relevant deviations, even in situations of stress. The risk appetite framework is integrated in the management and determines the basic lines of activity of the Group, because it sets the framework within the budget is developed.During 2016, the Risk Appetite metrics evolved in line with the set profile.7.1.3 Decisiones y procesosThe transfer of risk appetite framework to ordinary management is supported by three basic aspects:A standardized set of regulationsRisk planningComprehensive management of risks over their life cycleStandardized regulatory frameworkThe corporate GRM area is responsible for proposing the definition and development of the corporate policies, specific rules, procedures and schemes of delegation based on which risk decisions should be taken within the Group.This process aims for the following objectives:Hierarchy and structure: well-structured information through a clear and simple hierarchy creating relations between documents that depend on each other.Simplicity: an appropriate and sufficient number of documents.Standardization: a standardized name and content of document.Accessibility: ability to search for, and easy access to, documentation through the corporate risk management library.The approval of corporate policies for all types of risks corresponds to the corporate bodies of the Bank, while the corporate risk area endorses the remaining regulations.Risk units of geographical and / or business areas continue to adapt to local requirements the regulatory framework for the purpose of having a decision process that is appropriate at local level and aligned with the Group policies. If such adaptation is necessary, the local risk area must inform the corporate GRM area, which must ensure the consistency of the set of regulations at the level of the entire Group, and thus must give its approval prior to any modifications proposed by the local risk areas.Risk planningRisk planning ensures that the risk appetite framework is integrated into management through a cascade process for establishing limits and profitability adjusted to the risk profile, in which the function of the corporate area risk units and the geographical and/or business areas is to guarantee the alignment of this process against the Group’s risk appetite framework in terms of solvency, profitability, liquidity and funding.It has tools in place that allow the risk appetite framework defined at aggregate level to be assigned and monitored by business areas, legal entities, types of risk, concentrations and any other level considered necessary.The risk planning process is present within the rest of the Group’s planning framework so as to ensure consistency among all of them.Daily risk managementAll risks must be managed comprehensively during their life cycle, and be treated differently depending on the type.The risk management cycle is composed of 5 elements:Planning: with the aim of ensuring that the Group’s activities are consistent with the target risk profile and guaranteeing solvency in the development of the strategy.Assessment: a process focused on identifying all the risks inherent to the activities carried out by the Group.Formalization: includes the risk origination, approval and formalization stages.Monitoring and reporting: continuous and structured monitoring of risks and preparation of reports for internal and/or external (market, investors, etc.) consumption.Active portfolio management: focused on identifying business opportunities in existing portfolios and new markets, businesses and products.7.1.4 Assessment, monitoring and reportingAssessment, monitoring and reporting is a cross-cutting element that should ensure that the Model has a dynamic and proactive vision to enable compliance with the risk appetite framework approved by the corporate bodies, even in adverse scenarios. The materialization of this process has the following objectives:Assess compliance with the risk appetite framework at the present time, through monitoring of the core metrics, metrics by type of risk and the basic structure of limits.Assess compliance with the risk appetite framework in the future, through the projection of the risk appetite framework variables, in both a baseline scenario determined by the budget and a risk scenario determined by the stress tests.Identify and assess the risk factors and scenarios that could compromise compliance with the risk appetite framework, through the development of a risk repository and an analysis of the impact of those risks.Act to mitigate the impact in the Group of the identified risk factors and scenarios, ensuring this impact remains within the target risk profile.Supervise the key variables that are not a direct part of the risk appetite framework, but that condition its compliance. These can be either external or internal.This process is integrated in the activity of the risk units, both of the corporate area and in the business units, and it is carried out during the following phases:Identification of risk factors, aimed at generating a map with the most relevant risk factors that can compromise the Group’s performance in relation to the thresholds defined in the risk appetite framework.Impact evaluation. This involves evaluating the impact that the materialization of one (or more) of the risk factors identified in the previous phase could have on the risk appetite framework metrics, through the occurrence of a given scenario.Response to undesired situations and realignment measures. Exceeding the parameters will trigger an analysis of the realignment measures to enable dynamic management of the situation, even before it occurs.Monitoring. The aim is to avoid losses before they occur by monitoring the Group’s current risk profile and the identified risk factors.Reporting. This aims to provide information on the assumed risk profile by offering accurate, complete and reliable data to the corporate bodies and to senior management, with the frequency and completeness appropriate to the nature, significance and complexity of the risks.7.1.5 InfrastructureThe infrastructure is an element that must ensure that the Group has the human and technological resources needed for effective management and supervision of risks in order to carry out the functions set out in the Group’s risk Model and the achievement of their objectives.With respect to human resources, the Group’s risk function has an adequate workforce, in terms of number, skills, knowledge and experience.With regards to technology, the Group ensures the integrity of management information systems and the provision of the infrastructure needed for supporting risk management, including tools appropriate to the needs arising from the different types of risks for their admission, management, assessment and monitoring.The principles that govern the Group risk technology are:Standardization: the criteria are consistent across the Group, thus ensuring that risk handling is standardized at geographical and/or business area level.Integration in management: the tools incorporate the corporate risk policies and are applied in the Group’s day-to-day management.Automation of the main processes making up the risk management cycle.Appropriateness: provision of adequate information at the right time.Through the “Risk Analytics” function, the Group has a corporate framework in place for developing the measurement techniques and models. It covers all the types of risks and the different purposes and uses a standard language for all the activities and geographical/business areas and decentralized execution to make the most of the Group’s global reach. The aim is to continually evolve the existing risk models and generate others that cover the new areas of the businesses that develop them, so as to reinforce the anticipation and proactiveness that characterize the Group’s risk function.Also the risk units of geographical and / or business areas have sufficient means from the point of view of resources, structures and tools to develop a risk management in line with the corporate model.7.1.6 Risk cultureBBVA considers risk culture to be an essential element for consolidating and integrating the other components of the Model. The culture transfers the implications that are involved in the Group’s activities and businesses to all the levels of the organization. The risk culture is organized through a number of levers, including the following:Communication: promotes the dissemination of the Model, and in particular the principles that must govern risk management in the Group, in a consistent and integrated manner across the organization, through the most appropriate channels. GRM has a number of communication channels to facilitate the transmission of information and knowledge among the various teams in the function and the Group, adapting the frequency, formats and recipients based on the proposed goal, in order to strengthen the basic principles of the risk function. The risk culture and the management model thus emanate from the Group’s corporate bodies and senior management and are transmitted throughout the organization.Training: its main aim is to disseminate and establish the model of risk management across the organization, ensuring standards in the skills and knowledge of the different persons involved in the risk management processes.Well defined and implemented training ensures continuous improvement of the skills and knowledge of the Group’s professionals, and in particular of the GRM area, and is based on four aspects that aim to develop each of the needs of the GRM group by increasing its knowledge and skills in different fields such as: finance and risks, tools and technology, management and skills, and languages.Motivation: the aim in this area is for the incentives of the risk function teams to support the strategy for managing those teams and the function’s values and culture at all levels. Includes compensation and all those elements related to motivation – working environment, etc. which contribute to the achievement Model objectives.7.2 Risk factorsAs mentioned earlier, BBVA has processes in place for identifying risks and analyzing scenarios that enable the Group to manage risks in a dynamic and proactive way.The risk identification processes are forward looking to ensure the identification of emerging risks and take into account the concerns of both the business areas, which are close to the reality of the different geographical areas, and the corporate areas and senior management.Risks are captured and measured consistently using the methodologies deemed appropriate in each case. Their measurement includes the design and application of scenario analyses and stress testing and considers the controls to which the risks are subjected.As part of this process, a forward projection of the risk appetite framework variables in stress scenarios is conducted in order to identify possible deviations from the established thresholds. If any such deviations are detected, appropriate measures are taken to keep the variables within the target risk profile.To this extent, there are a number of emerging risks that could affect the Group’s business trends. These risks are described in the following main blocks:Macroeconomic and geopolitical risksAccording to the latest information available, global growth remains stable at approximately 3% year-on- year. Throughout the year there was an increase in the dynamism of global trade, the manufacturing cycle and the confidence indicators, due to lax monetary conditions, fiscal policies that, although not expansive, are also not cyclical, moderate raw material prices, especially oil prices (which favors the demand of importing economies) and the gradual reduction of the accumulated private leverage excess in developed economies. All of this would favor a slight improvement in global growth in 2017. The risks of this scenario are compounded by:increasing vulnerabilities in China caused by the accumulation of corporate debt;uncertainty about the effective implementation of Great Britain’s UE exit process;uncertainty arising from the potential increase in trade protectionism. All this in a complex geopolitical environmentThe remaining events that make up the uncertainties for 2017, which could affect the valuation of the Group’s holdings in certain countries:Upward inflationary pressure and downward pressure on Mexico’s growth. The Central Bank of Mexico (Banxico) has continued the interest rate increases since the end of 2015, around 50 basis points per quarter, to 5.75% in December. Next steps are likely to go in the same direction to counteract upward inflationary pressure and expectations against the depreciation of the Mexican peso (in 2016, -13.1% year-on-year depreciation against the euro). This behavior results from the deterioration of Mexico’s growth expectations, assuming a less favorable framework for trade relations with the United States.In terms of geopolitical tensions in some geographies, it is noteworthy the uncertainty following the attempt of coup d’etat last July in Turkey, which together with the tightening of global financing conditions favors an intense slowdown in economic growth. Information on the macroeconomic and industry environment in each of the geographical areas where the Group operates mentions in the Business Areas section of the Management Report. In this regard, the Group’s geographical diversification is a key element in achieving a high level of revenue recurrence, despite the environmental conditions and economic cycles of the economies in which it operates.Regulatory and reputational risksFinancial institutions are exposed to a complex and ever-changing regulatory environment defined by governments and regulators. This can affect their ability to grow and the capacity of certain businesses to develop, and result in stricter liquidity and capital requirements with lower profitability ratios. The Group constantly monitors changes in the regulatory framework that allow for anticipation and adaptation to them in a timely manner, adopt best practices and more efficient and rigorous criteria in its implementation.The financial sector is under ever closer scrutiny by regulators, governments and society itself. Negative news or inappropriate behavior can significantly damage the Group’s reputation and affect its ability to develop a sustainable business. The attitudes and behaviors of the group and its members are governed by the principles of integrity, honesty, long-term vision and best practices through, inter alia, internal control Model, the Code of Conduct, tax strategy and Responsible Business Strategy of the Group.Business, operational and legal risksNew technologies and forms of customer relationships: Developments in the digital world and in information technologies pose significant challenges for financial institutions, entailing threats (new competitors, disintermediation…) but also opportunities (new framework of relations with customers, greater ability to adapt to their needs, new products and distribution channels…). Digital transformation is a priority for the Group as it aims to lead digital banking of the future as one of its objectives.Technological risks and security breaches: The Group is exposed to new threats such as cyber-attacks, theft of internal and customer databases, fraud in payment systems, etc. that require major investments in security from both the technological and human point of view. The Group gives great importance to the active operational and technological risk management and control. One example was the early adoption of advanced models for management of these risks (AMA - Advanced Measurement Approach).The financial sector is exposed to increasing litigation, so the financial institutions face a large number of proceedings which economic consequences are difficult to determine. The Group manages and monitors these proceedings to defend its interests, where necessary allocating the corresponding provisions to cover them, following the expert criteria of internal lawyers and external attorneys responsible for the legal handling of the procedures, in accordance with applicable legislation.7.3 Credit riskCredit risk arises from the probability that one party to a financial instrument will fail to meet its contractual obligations for reasons of insolvency or inability to pay and cause a financial loss for the other party.It is the most important risk for the Group and includes counterparty risk, issuer risk, settlement risk and country risk management.The principles underpinning credit risk management in BBVA are as follows:Availability of basic information for the study and proposal of risk, and supporting documentation for approval, which sets out the conditions required by the internal relevant body.Sufficient generation of funds and asset solvency of the customer to assume principal and interest repayments of loans owed.Establishment of adequate and sufficient guarantees that allow effective recovery of the operation, this being considered a secondary and exceptional method of recovery when the first has failed.Credit risk management in the Group has an integrated structure for all its functions, allowing decisions to be taken objectively and independently throughout the life cycle of the risk.At Group level: frameworks for action and standard rules of conduct are defined for handling risk, specifically, the circuits, procedures, structure and supervision.At the business area level: they are responsible for adapting the Group’s criteria to the local realities of each geographical area and for direct management of risk according to the decision-making circuit:Retail risks: in general, the decisions are formalized according to the scoring tools, within the general framework for action of each business area with regard to risks. The changes in weighting and variables of these tools must be validated by the corporate GRM area.Wholesale risks: in general, the decisions are formalized by each business area within its general framework for action with regard to risks, which incorporates the delegation rule and the Group’s corporate policies.7.3.1 Credit risk exposureIn accordance with IFRS 7, “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” the BBVA Group’s maximum credit risk exposure (see definition below) by headings in the balance sheets as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is provided below. It does not consider the availability of collateral or other credit enhancements to guarantee compliance with payment obligations. The details are broken down by financial instruments and counterparties.Millions of EurosMaximum Credit Risk ExposureNotes201620152014Financial assets held for trading10 31,99537,42439,028Debt securities&amp;nbsp;27,16632,82533,883&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Government&amp;nbsp;24,16529,45428,212&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Credit institutions&amp;nbsp;1,6521,7653,048&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Other sectors&amp;nbsp;1,3491,6062,623Equity instruments&amp;nbsp;4,6754,5345,017Customer lending &amp;nbsp;15465128Other financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss 11 2,0622,3112,761Loans and advances to credit institutions&amp;nbsp;-62-Debt securities &amp;nbsp;142173737&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Government&amp;nbsp;84132141&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Credit institutions&amp;nbsp;472916&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Other sectors&amp;nbsp;1111580Equity instruments&amp;nbsp;1,9202,0752,024Available-for-sale financial assets12 79,553113,71095,049Debt securities&amp;nbsp;74,739108,44887,679&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Government&amp;nbsp;55,04781,57963,764&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Credit institutions&amp;nbsp;5,0118,0697,377&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Other sectors&amp;nbsp;14,68218,80016,538Equity instruments&amp;nbsp;4,8145,2627,370Loans and receivables&amp;nbsp;482,011490,580390,362Loans and advances to central banks13.18,89417,8305,429Loans and advances to credit institutions13.131,41629,36825,371Loans and advances to customers13.2430,474432,856352,900&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Government&amp;nbsp;34,87338,61137,113&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Agriculture&amp;nbsp;4,3124,3154,348&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Industry&amp;nbsp;57,07256,91337,580&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Real estate and construction&amp;nbsp;37,00238,96433,152&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Trade and finance&amp;nbsp;47,04543,57643,880&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Loans to individuals&amp;nbsp;192,281194,288158,586&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Other&amp;nbsp;57,88956,18838,242Debt securities13.311,22610,5266,663&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Government&amp;nbsp;4,7093,2755,608&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Credit institutions&amp;nbsp;3712581&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Other sectors&amp;nbsp;6,4817,126975Held-to-maturity investments14 17,710--&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Government&amp;nbsp;16,049--&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Credit institutions&amp;nbsp;1,515--&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Other sectors&amp;nbsp;146--Derivatives (trading and hedging)&amp;nbsp;54,12249,35047,248Total Financial Assets Risk&amp;nbsp;667,454693,375574,448Loan commitments given&amp;nbsp;107,254123,62096,714Financial guarantees given&amp;nbsp;18,26719,17614,398Other Commitments given&amp;nbsp;42,59242,81328,881Total Loan commitments and financial guarantees33 168,113185,609139,993Total Maximum Credit Exposure&amp;nbsp;835,567878,984714,441Download tableThe maximum credit exposure presented in the table above is determined by type of financial asset as explained below:In the case of financial assets recognized in the consolidated balance sheets, exposure to credit risk is considered equal to its carrying amount (not including impairment losses), with the sole exception of derivatives and hedging derivatives.The maximum credit risk exposure on financial guarantees granted is the maximum that the Group would be liable for if these guarantees were called in, and that is their carrying amount.Our calculation of risk exposure for derivatives is based on the sum of two factors: the derivatives fair value and their potential risk (or “add-on”). – The first factor, fair value, reflects the difference between original commitments and fair values on the reporting date (mark-to-market). As indicated in Note 2.2.1, derivatives are accounted for as of each reporting date at fair value in accordance with IAS 39. – The second factor, potential risk (‘add-on’), is an estimate of the maximum increase to be expected on risk exposure over a derivative fair value (at a given statistical confidence level) as a result of future changes in the fair value over the remaining term of the derivatives.The consideration of the potential risk (“add-on”) relates the risk exposure to the exposure level at the time of a customer’s default. The exposure level will depend on the customer’s credit quality and the type of transaction with such customer. Given the fact that default is an uncertain event which might occur any time during the life of a contract, the BBVA Group has to consider not only the credit exposure of the derivatives on the reporting date, but also the potential changes in exposure during the life of the contract. This is especially important for derivatives, whose valuation changes substantially throughout their terms, depending on the fluctuation of market prices.The breakdown by counterparty and product of loans and advances, net of impairment losses, classified in the different headings of the assets, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 is shown below:Millions of EurosDecember 2016Central banksGeneral governmentsCredit institutionsOther financial corporationsNon-financial corporationsHouseholdsTotalOn demand and short notice-373-2468,1252,50711,251Credit card debt-1-11,87514,71916,596Trade receivables&amp;nbsp;2,091-99820,24641823,753Finance leases-261-578,6474779,442Reverse repurchase loans8154415,5976,746--22,968Other term loans8,81429,1407,6946,878136,105167,892356,524Advances that are not loans-2,4108,0832,0821,19462014,389Loans and advances8,89434,82031,37317,009176,192186,633454,921of which: mortgage loans (Loans collateralized by immovable property)&amp;nbsp;4,72211269044,406132,398182,328of which: other collateralized loans&amp;nbsp;3,70015,1918,16421,8636,06154,979of which: credit for consumption&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;44,50444,504of which: lending for house purchase&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;127,606127,606of which: project finance loans&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;19,269&amp;nbsp;19,269Download tableMillions of EurosDecember 2015Central banksGeneral governmentsCredit institutionsOther financial corporationsNon-financial corporationsHouseholdsTotalOn demand and short notice-783-388,3562,05011,228Credit card debt-1-21,89215,05716,952Trade receivables&amp;nbsp;3,055-80019,60541123,871Finance leases-301-4207,5341,1039,357Reverse repurchase loans14932611,6764,7179-16,877Other term loans10,01731,9718,9905,968134,952168,729360,626Advances that are not loans7,6642,1088,7132,26191986322,528Loans and advances17,83038,54429,37914,206173,267188,213461,438of which: mortgage loans (Loans collateralized by immovable property)&amp;nbsp;4,48326465643,961135,102184,466of which: other collateralized loans&amp;nbsp;3,86812,4346,08522,9286,13151,446of which: credit for consumption&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;40,90640,906of which: lending for house purchase&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;126,591126,591of which: project finance loans&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21,141&amp;nbsp;21,141Download table7.3.2 Mitigation of credit risk, collateralized credit risk and other credit enhancementsIn most cases, maximum credit risk exposure is reduced by collateral, credit enhancements and other actions which mitigate the Group’s exposure. The BBVA Group applies a credit risk hedging and mitigation policy deriving from a banking approach focused on relationship banking. The existence of guarantees could be a necessary but not sufficient instrument for accepting risks, as the assumption of risks by the Group requires prior evaluation of the debtor’s capacity for repayment, or that the debtor can generate sufficient resources to allow the amortization of the risk incurred under the agreed terms.The policy of accepting risks is therefore organized into three different levels in the BBVA Group:Analysis of the financial risk of the operation, based on the debtor’s capacity for repayment or generation of funds;The constitution of guarantees that are adequate, or at any rate generally accepted, for the risk assumed, in any of the generally accepted forms: monetary, secured, personal or hedge guarantees; and finally,Assessment of the repayment risk (asset liquidity) of the guarantees received.The procedures for the management and valuation of collaterals are set out in the Corporate Policies (retail and wholesale), which establish the basic principles for credit risk management, including the management of collaterals assigned in transactions with customers.The methods used to value the collateral are in line with the best market practices and imply the use of appraisal of real-estate collateral, the market price in market securities, the trading price of shares in mutual funds, etc. All the collaterals assigned must be properly drawn up and entered in the corresponding register. They must also have the approval of the Group’s legal units.The following is a description of the main types of collateral for each financial instrument class:Financial instruments held for trading: The guarantees or credit enhancements obtained directly from the issuer or counterparty are implicit in the clauses of the instrument.Derivatives and hedging derivatives: In derivatives, credit risk is minimized through contractual netting agreements, where positive- and negative-value derivatives with the same counterparty are offset for their net balance. There may likewise be other kinds of guarantees, depending on counterparty solvency and the nature of the transaction.Other financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss and Available-for-sale financial assets: The guarantees or credit enhancements obtained directly from the issuer or counterparty are inherent to the structure of the instrument.Loans and receivables:Loans and advances to credit institutions: These usually only have the counterparty’s personal guarantee.Loans and advances to customers: Most of these loans and advances are backed by personal guarantees extended by the own customer. There may also be collateral to secure loans and advances to customers (such as mortgages, cash collaterals, pledged securities and other collateral), or to obtain other credit enhancements (bonds, hedging, etc.).Debt securities: The guarantees or credit enhancements obtained directly from the issuer or counterparty are inherent to the structure of the instrument.Collateralized loans granted by the Group as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 excluding balances deemed impaired, is broken down in Note 13.2.Financial guarantees, other contingent risks and drawable by third parties: These have the counterparty’s personal guarantee.7.3.3 Credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impairedThe BBVA Group has tools (“scoring” and “rating”) that enable it to rank the credit quality of its operations and customers based on an assessment and its correspondence with the probability of default (“PD”) scales. To analyze the performance of PD, the Group has a series of tracking tools and historical databases that collect the pertinent internally generated information, which can basically be grouped together into scoring and rating models.ScoringScoring is a decision-making model that contributes to both the arrangement and management of retail loans: consumer loans, mortgages, credit cards for individuals, etc. Scoring is the tool used to decide to originate a loan, what amount should be originated and what strategies can help establish the price, because it is an algorithm that sorts transactions by their credit quality. This algorithm enables the BBVA Group to assign a score to each transaction requested by a customer, on the basis of a series of objective characteristics that have statistically been shown to discriminate between the quality and risk of this type of transactions. The advantage of scoring lies in its simplicity and homogeneity: all that is needed is a series of objective data for each customer, and this data is analyzed automatically using an algorithm.There are three types of scoring, based on the information used and on its purpose:Reactive scoring: measures the risk of a transaction requested by an individual using variables relating to the requested transaction and to the customer’s socio-economic data available at the time of the request. The new transaction is approved or rejected depending on the score.Behavioral scoring: scores transactions for a given product in an outstanding risk portfolio of the entity, enabling the credit rating to be tracked and the customer’s needs to be anticipated. It uses transaction and customer variables available internally. Specifically, variables that refer to the behavior of both the product and the customer.Proactive scoring: gives a score at customer level using variables related to the individual’s general behavior with the entity, and to his/her payment behavior in all the contracted products. The purpose is to track the customer’s credit quality and it is used to pre-grant new transactions.RatingRating tools, as opposed to scoring tools, do not assess transactions but focus on the rating of customers instead: companies, corporations, SMEs, general governments, etc. A rating tool is an instrument that, based on a detailed financial study, helps determine a customer’s ability to meet his/her financial obligations. The final rating is usually a combination of various factors: on one hand, quantitative factors, and on the other hand, qualitative factors. It is a middle road between an individual analysis and a statistical analysis.The main difference between ratings and scorings is that the latter are used to assess retail products, while ratings use a wholesale banking customer approach. Moreover, scorings only include objective variables, while ratings add qualitative information. And although both are based on statistical studies, adding a business view, rating tools give more weight to the business criterion compared to scoring tools.For portfolios where the number of defaults is very low (sovereign risk, corporates, financial entities, etc.) the internal information is supplemented by “benchmarking” of the external rating agencies (Moody’s, Standard &amp;amp; Poor’s and Fitch). To this end, each year the PDs compiled by the rating agencies at each level of risk rating are compared, and the measurements compiled by the various agencies are mapped against those of the BBVA master rating scale.Once the probability of default of a transaction or customer has been calculated, a “business cycle adjustment” is carried out. This is a means of establishing a measure of risk that goes beyond the time of its calculation. The aim is to capture representative information of the behavior of portfolios over a complete economic cycle. This probability is linked to the Master Rating Scale prepared by the BBVA Group to enable uniform classification of the Group’s various asset risk portfolios.The table below shows the abridged scale used to classify the BBVA Group’s outstanding risk as of December 31, 2016:External ratingInternal ratingProbability of default (basic points) Escala Standard&amp;amp;Poor&#39;sReduced List (22 groups)AverageMinimum from &amp;gt;=MaximumAAAAAA1-2AA+AA+223AAAA334AA-AA-445A+A+556AA869A-A-10911BBB+BBB+141117BBBBBB201724BBB-BBB-312439BB+BB+513967BBBB8867116BB-BB-150116194B+B+255194335BB441335581B-B-7855811,061CCC+CCC+1,1911,0611,336CCCCCC1,5001,3361,684CCC-CCC-1,8901,6842,121CC+CC+2,3812,1212,673CCCC3,0002,6733,367CC-CC-3,7803,3674,243Download tableThese different levels and their probability of default were calculated by using as a reference the rating scales and default rates provided by the external agencies Standard &amp;amp; Poor’s and Moody’s. These calculations establish the levels of probability of default for the BBVA Group’s Master Rating Scale. Although this scale is common to the entire Group, the calibrations (mapping scores to PD sections/Master Rating Scale levels) are carried out at tool level for each country in which the Group has tools available.The table below outlines the distribution of exposure, including derivatives, by internal ratings, to corporates, financial entities and institutions (excluding sovereign risk), of

to refinancing and restructuring operationsRefinancing and restructuring operations (see definition in the Glossary) are carried out with customers who have requested such an operation in order to meet their current loan payments if they are expected, or may be expected, to experience financial difficulty in making the payments in the future.The basic aim of a refinancing and restructuring operation is to provide the customer with a situation of financial viability over time by adapting repayment of the loan incurred with the Group to the customer’s new situation of fund generation. The use of refinancing and restructuring for other purposes, such as to delay loss recognition, is contrary to BBVA Group policies.The BBVA Group’s refinancing and restructuring policies are based on the following general principles:Refinancing and restructuring is authorized according to the capacity of customers to pay the new installments. This is done by first identifying the origin of the payment difficulties and then carrying out an analysis of the customers’ viability, including an updated analysis of their economic and financial situation and capacity to pay and generate funds. If the customer is a company, the analysis also covers the situation of the industry in which it operates.With the aim of increasing the solvency of the operation, new guarantees and/or guarantors of demonstrable solvency are obtained where possible. An essential part of this process is an analysis of the effectiveness of both the new and original guarantees.This analysis is carried out from the overall customer or group perspective.Refinancing and restructuring operations do not in general increase the amount of the customer’s loan, except for the expenses inherent to the operation itself.The capacity to refinance and restructure loan is not delegated to the branches, but decided on by the risk units.The decisions made are reviewed from time to time with the aim of evaluating full compliance with refinancing and restructuring policies.These general principles are adapted in each case according to the conditions and circumstances of each geographical area in which the Group operates, and to the different types of customers involved. In the case of retail customers (private individuals), the main aim of the BBVA Group’s policy on refinancing and restructuring loan is to avoid default arising from a customer’s temporary liquidity problems by implementing structural solutions that do not increase the balance of customer’s loan. The solution required is adapted to each case and the loan repayment is made easier, in accordance with the following principles:Analysis of the viability of operations based on the customer’s willingness and ability to pay, which may be reduced, but should nevertheless be present. The customer must therefore repay at least the interest on the operation in all cases. No arrangements may be concluded that involve a grace period for both principal and interest.Refinancing and restructuring of operations is only allowed on those loans in which the BBVA Group originally entered into.Customers subject to refinancing and restructuring operations are excluded from marketing campaigns of any kind.In the case of non-retail customers (mainly companies, enterprises and corporates), refinancing/restructuring is authorized according to an economic and financial viability plan based on:Forecasted future income, margins and cash flows over a sufficiently long period (around five years) to allow entities to implement cost adjustment measures (industrial restructuring) and a business development plan that can help reduce the level of leverage to sustainable levels (capacity to access the financial markets).Where appropriate, the existence of a divestment plan for assets and/or operating segments that can generate cash to assist the deleveraging process.The capacity of shareholders to contribute capital and/or guarantees that can support the viability of the plan.In accordance with the Group’s policy, the conclusion of a loan refinancing and restructuring operation does not imply the loan is reclassified from “impaired” or “standard under special monitoring” to outstanding risk; such a reclassification must be based on the analysis mentioned earlier of the viability and sufficiency of the new guarantees provided.The Group maintains the policy of including risks related to refinanced and restructured loans as either:“Impaired assets”, as although the customer is up to date with payments, they are classified as impaired for reasons other than their default when there are significant doubts that the terms of their refinancing may not be met; or“Normal-risk assets” (although as mentioned in the table in the following section, they continue to be classified as “ standard under special monitoring” until the conditions established for their consideration as outstanding risk are met).The conditions established for “standard under special monitoring” to be reclassified out of this category are as follows:The customer must have paid past-due amounts (principal and interest) since the date of the renegotiation or restructuring of the loan;At least two years must have elapsed since completion of the renegotiation or restructuring of the loan;The customer must have paid at least 10% of the outstanding principal amount of the loan as well as all the past-due amounts (principal and interest) that were outstanding as of the date of the renegotiation or restructuring of the loan; andIt is unlikely that the customer will have financial difficulties and, therefore, it is expected that the customer will be able to meet its loan payment obligations (principal and interest) in a timely manner.The BBVA Group’s refinancing and restructuring policy provides for the possibility of two modifications in a 24 month period for loans that are not in compliance with the payment schedule.The internal models used to determine allowances for loan losses consider the restructuring and renegotiation of a loan, as well as re-defaults on such a loan, by assigning a lower internal rating to restructured and renegotiated loans than the average internal rating assigned to non-restructured/renegotiated loans. This downgrade results in an increase in the probability of default (PD) assigned to restructured/renegotiated loans (with the resulting PD being higher than the average PD of the non- renegotiated loans in the same portfolios).”For quantitative information on refinancing and restructuring operations see Appendix XI.7.4 Market risk7.4.1 Market risk portfoliosMarket risk originates as a result of movements in the market variables that impact the valuation of traded financial products and assets. The main risks generated can be classified as follows:Interest-rate risk: This arises as a result of exposure to movements in the different interest-rate curves involved in trading. Although the typical products that generate sensitivity to the movements in interest rates are money-market products (deposits, interest-rate futures, call money swaps, etc.) and traditional interestrate derivatives (swaps and interest-rate options such as caps, floors, swaptions, etc.), practically all the financial products are exposed to interest-rate movements due to the effect that such movements have on the valuation of the financial discount.Equity risk: This arises as a result of movements in share prices. This risk is generated in spot positions in shares or any derivative products whose underlying asset is a share or an equity index. Dividend risk is a subrisk of equity risk, arising as an input for any equity option. Its variation may affect the valuation of positions and it is therefore a factor that generates risk on the books.Exchange-rate risk: This is caused by movements in the exchange rates of the different currencies in which a position is held. As in the case of equity risk, this risk is generated in spot currency positions, and in any derivative product whose underlying asset is an exchange rate. In addition, the quanto effect (operations where the underlying asset and the instrument itself are denominated in different currencies) means that in certain transactions in which the underlying asset is not a currency, an exchange-rate risk is generated that has to be measured and monitored.Credit-spread risk: Credit spread is an indicator of an issuer’s credit quality. Spread risk occurs due to variations in the levels of spread of both corporate and government issues, and affects positions in bonds and credit derivatives.Volatility risk: This occurs as a result of changes in the levels of implied price volatility of the different market instruments on which derivatives are traded. This risk, unlike the others, is exclusively a component of trading in derivatives and is defined as a first-order convexity risk that is generated in all possible underlying assets in which there are products with options that require a volatility input for their valuation.The metrics developed to control and monitor market risk in BBVA Group are aligned with best practices in the market and are implemented consistently across all the local market risk units.Measurement procedures are established in terms of the possible impact of negative market conditions on the trading portfolio of the Group’s Global Markets units, both under ordinary circumstances and in situations of heightened risk factors.The standard metric used to measure market risk is Value at Risk (“VaR”), which indicates the maximum loss that may occur in the portfolios at a given confidence level (99%) and time horizon (one day). This statistic value is widely used in the market and has the advantage of summing up in a single metric the risks inherent to trading activity, taking into account how they are related and providing a prediction of the loss that the trading book could sustain as a result of fluctuations in equity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. The market risk analysis considers risks, such as credit spread, basis risk, volatility and correlation risk.Most of the headings on the Group’s consolidated balance sheet subject to market risk are positions whose main metric for measuring their market risk is VaR. This table shows the accounting lines of the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 in which there is a market risk in trading activity subject to this measurement:Millions of EurosDecember 2016December 2015Headings of the balance sheet under market riskMain market riskmetrics - VaRMain market riskmetrics -Others (*)Main market riskmetrics - VaRMain market riskmetrics -Others (*)Assets subject to market risk&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Financial assets held for trading64,6231,48064,3704,712 Available for sale financial assets7,11928,7718,23450,088&#39;Of which: Equity instruments-3,559-4,067 Hedging derivatives1,0411,4155281,888Liabilities subject to market risk&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Financial liabilities held for trading47,4912,22342,5506,277 Hedging derivatives1,3056891,128806Download table(*) Includes mainly assets and liabilities managed by COAP.Although the prior table shows details the financial positions subject to market risk, it should be noted that the data are for information purposes only and do not reflect how the risk is managed in trading activity, where it is not classified into assets and liabilities.With respect to the risk measurement models used in BBVA Group, the Bank of Spain has authorized the use of the internal model to determine bank capital requirements deriving from risk positions on the BBVA S.A. and BBVA Bancomer trading book, which jointly account for around 66% of the Group’s trading-book market risk. For the rest of the geographical areas (mainly South America, Garanti and BBVA Compass), bank capital for the risk positions in the trading book is calculated using the standard model.The current management structure includes the monitoring of market-risk limits, consisting of a scheme of limits based on VaR, economic capital (based on VaR measurements) and VaR sub-limits, as well as stop-loss limits for each of the Group’s business units.The model used estimates VaR in accordance with the “historical simulation” methodology, which involves estimating losses and gains that would have taken place in the current portfolio if the changes in market conditions that took place over a specific period of time in the past were repeated. Based on this information, it infers the maximum expected loss of the current portfolio within a given confidence level. This model has the advantage of reflecting precisely the historical distribution of the market variables and not assuming any specific distribution of probability. The historical period used in this model is two years. The historical simulation method is used in BBVA S.A., BBVA Bancomer, BBVA Chile, BBVA Colombia, Compass Bank and Garanti.VaR figures are estimated following two methodologies:VaR without smoothing, which awards equal weight to the daily information for the previous two years. This is currently the official methodology for measuring market risks for the purpose of monitoring compliance with risk limits.VaR with smoothing, which gives a greater weight to more recent market information. This metric supplements the previous one.In the case of South America (except BBVA Chile and BBVA Colombia), a parametric methodology is used to measure risk in terms of VaR.At the same time, and following the guidelines established by the Spanish and European authorities, BBVA incorporates metrics in addition to VaR with the aim of meeting the Bank of Spain’s regulatory requirements with respect to the calculation of bank capital for the trading book. Specifically, the new measures incorporated in the Group since December 2011 (stipulated by Basel 2.5) are:VaR: In regulatory terms, the VaR charge incorporates the stressed VaR charge, and the sum of the two (VaR and stressed VaR) is calculated. This quantifies the losses associated with the movements of the two risk factors inherent to market operations (interest rates, FX, RV, credit…). Both VaR and stressed VaR are rescaled by a regulatory multiplier set at three and by the square root of ten to calculate the capital charge.Specific Risk: Incremental Risk Capital (“IRC”) Quantification of the risks of default and downgrading of the credit ratings of the bond and credit derivative positions in the portfolio. The specific capital risk by IRC is a charge exclusively used in the geographical areas with the internal model approved (BBVA S.A. and Bancomer). The capital charge is determined according to the associated losses (at 99.9% in a 1-year horizon under the hypothesis of constant risk) due to the rating migration and/or default state the issuer of an asset. In addition, the price risk is included in sovereign positions for the items specified.Specific Risk: Securitization and correlation portfolios. Capital charge for securitizations and the correlation portfolio to include the potential losses associated at the level of rating a specific credit structure (rating). Both are calculated by the standard method. The scope of the correlation portfolios refers to the FTD-type market operation and/or tranches of market CDOs and only for positions with an active market and hedging capacity.Validity tests are performed regularly on the risk measurement models used by the Group. They estimate the maximum loss that could have been incurred in the positions with a certain level of probability (backtesting), as well as measurements of the impact of extreme market events on risk positions (stress testing). As an additional control measure, backtesting is conducted at trading desk level in order to enable more specific monitoring of the validity of the measurement models.Market risk in 2016The Group’s market risk remains at low levels compared with the risk aggregates managed by BBVA, particularly in terms of credit risk. This is due to the nature of the business. During 2016 the average VaR was €29 million, above 2015 figure, with a high on January 28, of €38 m. The evolution in the BBVA Group’s market risk during 2016, measured as VaR without smoothing (see Glossary) with a 99% confidence level and a 1-day horizon (shown in millions of Euros) is as follows:By type of market risk assumed by the Group’s trading portfolio, the main risk factor for the Group continues to be that linked to interest rates, with a weight of 58% of the total at the end of 2016 (this figure includes the spread risk). The relative weight has increased compared with the close of 2015 (48%). Exchange-rate risk accounts 13%, decreasing its proportion with respect to December 2015 (21%), while equity, volatility and correlation risk have decreased, with a weight of 29% at the close of 2016 (vs. 32% at the close of 2015).As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 the balance of VaR was €26 million, €24 million and €25 million respectively.

These tests showed that the internal market risk model of both BBVA, S.A. and Bancomer is adequate and precise.Two types of backtesting have been carried out during the year 2016:“Hypothetical” backtesting: the daily VaR is compared with the results obtained, not taking into account the intraday results or the changes in the portfolio positions. This validates the appropriateness of the market risk metrics for the end-of-day position.“Real” backtesting: the daily VaR is compared with the total results, including intraday transactions, but discounting the possible minimum charges or fees involved. This type of backtesting includes the intraday risk in portfolios.In addition, each of these two types of backtesting was carried out at the level of risk factor or business type, thus making a deeper comparison of the results with respect to risk measurements.For the period between the end of 2015 and the end of 2016, it was carried out the backtesting of the internal VaR calculation model, comparing the daily results obtained with the estimated risk level estimated by the internal VaR calculation model. At the end of the semester the comparison showed the internal VaR calculation model was working correctly, within the “green” zone (0-4 exceptions), thus validating the internal VaR calculation model, as has occurred each year since the internal market risk model was approved for the Group.Stress test analysisA number of stress tests are carried out on BBVA Group’s trading portfolios. First, global and local historical scenarios are used that replicate the behavior of an extreme past event, such as for example the collapse of Lehman Brothers or the “Tequilazo” crisis. These stress tests are complemented with simulated scenarios, where the aim is to generate scenarios that have a significant impact on the different portfolios, but without being anchored to any specific historical scenario. Finally, for some portfolios or positions, fixed stress tests are also carried out that have a significant impact on the market variables affecting these positions.Historical scenariosThe historical benchmark stress scenario for the BBVA Group is Lehman Brothers, whose sudden collapse in September 2008 led to a significant impact on the behavior of financial markets at a global level. The following are the most relevant effects of this historical scenario:Credit shock: reflected mainly in the increase of credit spreads and downgrades in credit ratings.Increased volatility in most of the financial markets (giving rise to a great deal of variation in the prices of different assets (currency, equity, debt).Liquidity shock in the financial systems, reflected by a major movement in interbank curves, particularly in the shortest sections of the euro and dollar curvesSimulated scenariosUnlike the historical scenarios, which are fixed and therefore not suited to the composition of the risk portfolio at all times, the scenario used for the exercises of economic stress is based on Resampling methodology. This methodology is based on the use of dynamic scenarios are recalculated periodically depending on the main risks held in the trading portfolios. On a data window wide enough to collect different periods of stress (data are taken from 1-1-2008 until today), a simulation is performed by resampling of historic observations, generating a loss distribution and profits to analyze most extreme of births in the selected historical window. The advantage of this resampling methodology is that the period of stress is not predetermined, but depends on the portfolio maintained at each time, and making a large number of simulations (10.000 simulations) allows a richer information for the analysis of expected shortfall than what is available in the scenarios included in the calculation of VaR.The main features of this approach are: a) the generated simulations respect the correlation structure of the data, b) flexibility in the inclusion of new risk factors and c) to allow the introduction of a lot of variability in the simulations (desirable to consider extreme events).The impact of the stress test under multivariable simulation of the risk factors of the portfolio (Expected shortfall 95% to 20 days) as of December 31, 2016 is as follows:Millions of EurosEuropeMexicoPeruVenezuelaArgentinaColombiaChileTurkeyExpected Shortfall(92)(42)(5)-(4)(1)(7)(24)Download table7.4.2 Structural riskThe Assets and Liabilities Committee (ALCO) is the key body for the management of structural risks relating to liquidity/funding, interest rates, solvency and currency rates. Every month, with representatives from the areas of Finance, Risks and Business Areas, this committee monitors the above risks and is presented with proposals for managing them for its approval. These management proposals are made proactively by the Finance area, taking into account the risk appetite framework and with the aim of guaranteeing recurrent earnings and preserving the entity’s solvency. All the balance-sheet management units have a local ALCO, assisted constantly by the members of the Corporate Center. There is also a corporate ALCO where the management strategies in the Group’s subsidiaries are monitored and presented.Structural interest-rate riskThe structural interest-rate risk (“SIRR”) is related to the potential impact that variations in market interest rates have on an entity’s net interest income and equity. In order to properly measure SIRR, BBVA takes into account the main sources that generate this risk: repricing risk, yield curve risk, option risk and basis risk, which are analyzed from two complementary points of view: net interest income (short term) and economic value (long term).ALCO monitors the interest-rate risk metrics and the Finance area carries out the management proposals for the structural balance sheet. The management objective is to ensure the stability of net interest income and book value in the face of changes in market interest rates, while respecting the internal solvency and limits in the different balance-sheets and for BBVA Group as a whole; and complying with current and future regulatory requirements.BBVA’s structural interest-rate risk management control and monitoring is based on a set of metrics and tools that enable the entity’s risk profile to be monitored correctly. A wide range of scenarios are measured on a regular basis, including sensitivities to parallel movements in the event of different shocks, changes in slope and curve, as well as delayed movements. Other probabilistic metrics based on statistical scenario-simulating methods are also assessed, such as income at risk (“IaR”) and economic capital (“EC”), which are defined as the maximum adverse deviations in net interest income and economic value, respectively, for a given confidence level and time horizon. Impact thresholds are established on these management metrics both in terms of deviations in net interest income and in terms of the impact on economic value. The process is carried out separately for each currency to which the Group is exposed, and the diversification effect between currencies and business units is considered after this.In order to guarantee its effectiveness, the model is subjected to regular internal validation, which includes backtesting. In addition, the banking book’s interest-rate risk exposures are subjected to different stress tests in order to reveal balance sheet vulnerabilities under extreme scenarios. This testing includes an analysis of adverse macroeconomic scenarios designed specifically by BBVA Research, together with a wide range of potential scenarios that aim to identify interest-rate environments that are particularly damaging for the entity. This is done by generating extreme scenarios of a breakthrough in interest rate levels and historical correlations, giving rise to sudden changes in the slopes and even to inverted curves.The model is necessarily underpinned by an elaborate set of hypotheses that aim to reproduce the behavior of the balance sheet as closely as possible to reality. Especially relevant among these assumptions are those related to the behavior of “accounts with no explicit maturity”, for which stability and remuneration assumptions are established, consistent with an adequate segmentation by type of product and customer, and prepayment estimates (implicit optionality). The hypotheses are reviewed and adapted, at least on an annual basis, to signs of changes in behavior, kept properly documented and reviewed on a regular basis in the internal validation processes.The impacts on the metrics are assessed both from a point of view of economic value (gone concern) and from the perspective of net interest income, for which a dynamic model (going concern) consistent with the corporate assumptions of earnings forecasts is used.The table below shows the profile of average sensitivities to net interest income and value of the main entities in BBVA Group in the first half of 2016:Impact on Net Interest Income (*) Impact on Economic Value (**)Sensitivity to Interest-Rate Analysis December 2016100 Basis-Point Increase100 Basis-Point Decrease100 Basis-Point Increase100 Basis-Point DecreaseEurope (***)14.12%(7.09%)4.90%(3.62%)Mexico2.13%(2.02%)(2.42%)2.55%USA8.91%(8.30%)0.41%(7.57%)Turkey(6.64%)4.64%(2.78%)3.84%South America2.40%(2.41%)(2.82%)3.04%BBVA Group4.15%(2.89%)2.69%(2.47%)Download table(*) Percentage of &quot;1 year&quot; net interest income forecast for each unit. (**) Percentage of net assets for each unit. (***) In Europe downward movement allowed until more negative level than current rates.In 2016 in Europe monetary policy has remained expansionary, which pushed interest rates lower, towards more negative levels in short term rates. In The United States, Fed’s reference interest rate continues the upward cycle initiated in 2015. While in Mexico, the upward interest rates cycle has intensified given the Mexican peso evolution and the inflation prospects, setting the rates level at the maximum since 2009. In Turkey, the weakness of the Turkish lira has led to a rise in rates in the last quarter of the year following declines in the first three quarters. The main economies of South America appear to have completed the cycle of increases initiated at the end of 2015.The BBVA Group in all its Balance Sheet Management Units (“BSMUs”) maintains a positive sensitivity in its net interest income to an increase in interest rates. Turkey, helps to diversify the Group’s net exposure due to the opposite direction of its position on Europe. The higher sensitivities in the net interest income, relatively speaking, are observed in mature markets (Europe and USA), where, however, the negative sensitivity in their net interest income to decrease in interest rates is limited by the plausible downward trend in interest rates. The Group maintains a moderate risk profile, according to its target risk, through effective management of its balance sheet structural risk.Structural exchange-rate riskIn BBVA Group, structural exchange-rate risk arises from the consolidation of holdings in subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the euro. Its management is centralized in order to optimize the joint handling of permanent foreign currency exposures, taking into account the diversification.The corporate Assets and Liabilities Management unit, through ALCO, designs and executes hedging strategies with the main purpose of controlling the potential negative effect of exchange-rate fluctuations on capital ratios and on the equivalent value in euros of the foreign-currency earnings of the Group’s subsidiaries, considering transactions according to market expectations and their cost.The risk monitoring metrics included in the system of limits are integrated into management and supplemented with additional assessment indicators. At corporate level they are based on probabilistic metrics that measure the maximum deviation in the Group’s Capital, CET1 (“Common Equity Tier 1”) ratio, and net attributable profit. The probabilistic metrics make it possible to estimate the joint impact of exposure to different currencies taking into account the different variability in exchange rates and their correlations.The suitability of these risk assessment metrics is reviewed on a regular basis through backtesting exercises. The final element of structural exchange-rate risk control is the analysis of scenarios and stress with the aim of identifying in advance possible threats to future compliance with the risk appetite levels set, so that any necessary preventive management actions can be taken. The scenarios are based both on historical situations simulated by the risk model and on the risk scenarios provided by BBVA Research.As for the market, in 2016 it is noteworthy the US dollar strength, boosted by higher yields, and the outperformance of the currencies of Andean area, while Mexican peso and Turkish lira depreciate against USD dollar, affected by higher uncertainty and concerns about the growth in these economies.The Group’s structural exchange-rate risk exposure level has decreased since the end of 2015 mostly due to the increased hedging, focused on Mexican peso and Turkish lira, intended to keep low levels of sensitivity to movements in the exchange rates of emerging currencies against the euro. The risk mitigation level in capital ratio due to the book value of BBVA Group’s holdings in foreign emerging currencies stood at around 70% and, as of the end of the year, CET1 ratio sensitivity to the appreciation of 1% in the euro exchange rate for each currency is: US Dollar: +1.2 bps; Mexican peso -0.2 bps; Turkish Lira -0.2 bps; other currencies: -0.3 bps. On the other hand, hedging of emerging-currency denominated earnings of 2016 stood at 47%, concentrated in Mexican peso and Turkish lira.Structural equity riskBBVA Group’s exposure to structural equity risk stems basically from investments in industrial and financial companies with medium- and long-term investment horizons. This exposure is mitigated through net short positions held in derivatives of their underlying assets, used to limit portfolio sensitivity to potential falls in prices.Structural management of equity portfolios is the responsibility of the Group’s units specializing in this area. Their activity is subject to the corporate risk management policies for equity positions in the equity portfolio. The aim is to ensure that they are handled consistently with BBVA’s business model and appropriately to its risk tolerance level, thus enabling long-term business sustainability.The Group’s risk management systems also make it possible to anticipate possible negative impacts and take appropriate measures to prevent damage being caused to the entity. The risk control and limitation mechanisms are focused on the exposure, annual operating performance and economic capital estimated for each portfolio. Economic capital is estimated in accordance with a corporate model based on Monte Carlo simulations, taking into account the statistical performance of asset prices and the diversification existing among the different exposures.Backtesting is carried out on a regular basis on the risk measurement model used.In the market, it is remarkable the underperformance of European stock markets in 2016, while main US stock exchange indices have reached historical maximum levels. It is also noteworthy the upsurge in stock prices volatility , and the initial shock in the financial markets after the Brexit, due to the policy uncertainty that this process entails and its potential impact on the Eurozone growth expectations. This effect led to a deterioration of capital gains accumulated in the Group’s equity portfolios as of the end of June, although it faded away as main equity indices have recovered pre-Brexit levels.Structural equity risk, measured in terms of economic capital, has decreased in the period as a result of the reduction of the stake in China Citic Bank, along with lower positioning in some sectors.Stress tests and analyses of sensitivity to different simulated scenarios are carried out periodically to analyze the risk profile in more depth. They are based on both past crisis situations and forecasts made by BBVA Research. This checks that the risks are limited and that the tolerance levels set by the Group are not at risk.The aggregate sensitivity of the BBVA Group’s consolidated equity to a 1% fall in the price of shares of the companies making up the equity portfolio stood at around -€38 million as of December 31, 2016. This estimate takes into account the exposure in shares valued at market prices, or if not applicable, at fair value (except for the positions in the Treasury Area portfolios) and the net delta-equivalent positions in options on the same underlyings.7.4.3 Financial Instruments compensationFinancial assets and liabilities may be netted, i.e. they are presented for a net amount on the consolidated balance sheet only when the Group’s entities satisfy with the provisions of IAS 32-Paragraph 42, so they have both the legal right to net recognized amounts, and the intention of settling the net amount or of realizing the asset and simultaneously paying the liability.In addition, the Group has presented as gross amounts assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet for which there are master netting arrangements in place, but for which there is no intention of settling net. The most common types of events that trigger the netting of reciprocal obligations are bankruptcy of the entity, surpassing certain level of indebtedness threshold, failure to pay, restructuring and dissolution of the entity.In the current market context, derivatives are contracted under different framework contracts being the most widespread developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) and, for the Spanish market, the Framework Agreement on Financial Transactions (“CMOF”). Almost all portfolio derivative transactions have been concluded under these framework contracts, including in them the netting clauses mentioned in the preceding paragraph as “Master Netting Agreement”, greatly reducing the credit exposure on these instruments. Additionally, in contracts signed with professional counterparties, the collateral agreement annexes called Credit Support Annex (“CSA”) are included, thereby minimizing exposure to a potential default of the counterparty.Moreover, in transactions involving assets purchased or sold under a purchase agreement there is a high volume transacted through clearing houses that articulate mechanisms to reduce counterparty risk, as well as through the signature of various master agreements for bilateral transactions, the most widely used being the Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA), published by International Capital Market Association (“ICMA”), to which the clauses related to the collateral exchange are usually added within the text of the master agreement itself.A summary of the effect of the compensation (via netting and collateral) for derivatives and securities operations is presented below as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:Millions of EurosGross Amounts Not Offset in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (D)December 2016NotesGross AmountsRecognized (A)Gross AmountsOffset in theCondensedConsolidatedBalance Sheets (B)Net AmountPresented in theCondensedConsolidatedBalance Sheets(C=A-B)FinancialInstrumentsCash CollateralReceived/ PledgedNet Amount (E=C-D)Trading and hedging derivatives10, 1559,37413,58745,78832,1466,5717,070Reverse repurchase, securities borrowing and similar agreements35 25,8332,91222,92123,080174(333)Total Assets&amp;nbsp;85,20816,49968,70955,2266,7456,738Trading and hedging derivatives 10, 1559,54514,08045,46532,1467,2726,047Repurchase, securities lending and similar agreements3549,4742,91246,56247,915176(1,529)Total Liabillities&amp;nbsp;109,01916,99192,02780,0617,4484,518Download tableMillions of EurosGross Amounts Not Offset in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (D) December 2015NotesGross AmountsRecognized (A)Gross AmountsOffset in theCondensedConsolidatedBalance Sheets (B)Net AmountPresented in theCondensedConsolidatedBalance Sheets(C=A-B)FinancialInstrumentsCash CollateralReceived/ PledgedNet Amount (E=C-D)Trading and hedging derivatives 10, 1552,2447,80544,43930,3505,4938,597Reverse repurchase, securities borrowing and similar agreements35 21,5314,59616,93517,31324(402)Total Assets&amp;nbsp;73,77512,40161,37447,6635,5178,195Trading and hedging derivatives 10, 1553,2988,42344,87630,3509,8304,696Repurchase, securities lending and similar agreements3572,9984,59668,40268,783114(495)Total Liabillities&amp;nbsp;126,29613,019113,27899,1339,9444,201Download table7.5 Liquidity risk7.5.1 Liquidity risk managementManagement of liquidity and structural finance within the BBVA Group is based on the principle of the financial autonomy of the entities that make it up. This approach helps prevent and limit liquidity risk by reducing the Group’s vulnerability in periods of high risk. This decentralized management avoids possible contagion due to a crisis that could affect only one or several BBVA Group entities, which must cover their liquidity needs independently in the markets where they operate. Liquidity Management Units (LMUs) have been set up for this reason in the geographical areas where the main foreign subsidiaries operate, and also for the parent BBVA S.A., within the Euro currency scope, which includes BBVA Portugal.Finance Division, through Global ALM, manages BBVA Group’s liquidity and funding. It plans and executes the funding of the long-term structural gap of each LMUs and proposes to ALCO the actions to adopt in this regard in accordance with the policies and limits established by the Standing Committee.As first core element, the Bank’s target behavior in terms of liquidity and funding risk is characterized through the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Loan-to-Stable-Customer-Deposits (LtSCD) ratio. LCR is a regulatory measurement aimed at ensuring entities’ resistance in a scenario of liquidity stress within a time horizon of 30 days. BBVA, within its risk appetite framework and its limits and alerts schemes, has established a level of requirement for compliance with the LCR ratio both for the Group as a whole and for each of the LMUs individually. The internal levels required are geared to comply sufficiently and efficiently in advance with the implementation of the regulatory requirement of 2018, at a level above 100%.Throughout 2016 the level of the LCR for BBVA Group has remained above 100%. At the European level the LCR ratio was effective beginning October 1, 2015, with an initial required level of 60%, and a phased-in level of up to 100% in 2018.The LtSCD measures the relation between the net credit investment and stable funds. The aim is to preserve a stable funding structure in the medium term for each of the LMUs making up BBVA Group, taking into account that maintaining an adequate volume of stable customer funds is key to achieving a sound liquidity profile.Customer funds captured and managed by business units are defined as stable customer funds. These funds usually show little sensitivity to market changes and are largely non-volatile in terms of aggregate amounts per operation, thanks to customer linkage to the unit. Stable funds in each LMU are calculated by analyzing the behavior of the balance sheets of the different customer segments identified as likely to provide stability to the funding structure, and by prioritizing an established relationship and applying bigger haircuts to the funding lines of less stable customers. The main base of stable funds is composed of deposits by individual customers and small businesses.For the purpose of establishing the (maximum) target levels for LtSCD in each LMU and providing an optimal funding structure reference in terms of risk appetite, GRM-Structural Risks identifies and assesses the economic and financial variables that condition the funding structures in the various geographical areas. The behavior of the indicators reflects that the funding structure remained robust in 2016, in the sense that all the LMUs maintain levels of self-funding with stable customer funds higher than the required levels.LtSCD by LMUDecember 2016December 2015Group (average)113%116%Eurozone113%116%Bancomer113%110%Compass108%112%Garanti124%128%Other LMUs107%111%Download tableThe second core element in liquidity and funding risk management is to achieve proper diversification of the funding structure, avoiding excessive reliance on short-term funding and establishing a maximum level of shortterm borrowing comprising both wholesale funding as well as less stable funds from non-retail customers. Regarding long-term funding, the maturity profile does not show significant concentrations, which enables adaptation of the anticipated issuance schedule to the best financial conditions of the markets. Finally, concentration risk is monitored at the LMU level, with a view to ensuring the right diversification both per counterparty and per instrument type.The third element promotes the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile, making sure that each LMU has sufficient collateral to address the risk of wholesale markets closing. Basic Capacity is the short-term liquidity risk management and control metric that is defined as the relationship between the available explicit assets and the maturities of wholesale liabilities and volatile funds, at different terms, with special relevance being given to 30day maturities.Each entity maintains an individual liquidity buffer, both Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA and its subsidiaries, including BBVA Compass, BBVA Bancomer, Garanti Bank and the Latin American subsidiaries.

They also play a key role in the design of the Liquidity Contingency Plan and in defining the specific measures for action for realigning the risk profile.For each of the scenarios, a check is carried out whether the Bank has a sufficient liquid assets to meet the liquidity commitments/outflows in the various periods analyzed. The analysis considers four scenarios, one core and three crisis-related: systemic crisis; unexpected internal crisis with a considerable rating downgrade and/or affecting the ability to issue in wholesale markets and the perception of business risk by the banking intermediaries and the bank’s customers; and a mixed scenario, as a combination of the two aforementioned scenarios. Each scenario considers the following factors: liquidity existing on the market, customer behavior and sources of funding, impact of rating downgrades, market values of liquid assets and collateral, and the interaction between liquidity requirements and the performance of the bank’s asset quality.The results of these stress analyses carried out regularly reveal that BBVA has a sufficient buffer of liquid assets to deal with the estimated liquidity outflows in a scenario such as a combination of a systemic crisis and an unexpected internal crisis, during a period in general longer than 3 months for LMUs, including a major downgrade in the bank’s rating (by up to three notches).Beside the results of stress exercises and risk metrics, Early Warning Indicators play an important role in the corporate model and also in the Liquidity Contingency Plan. These are mainly financing structure indicators, related to asset encumbrance, counterparty concentration, outflows of customer deposits, unexpected use of credit lines, and market indicators, which help to anticipate potential risks and capture market expectations.Below is a matrix of residual maturities by contractual periods based on supervisory prudential reporting as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:Millions of EurosDecember 2016 - Contractual MaturitiesDemandUp to 1 Month1 to 3 Months3 to 6 Months6 to 9 Months9 to 12 Months1 to 2 Years2 to 3 Years3 to 5 YearsOver 5 YearsTotalCash, cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits23,19113,825--------37,016Deposits in credit entities9914,0682541554872117871224,08710,002Deposits in other financial institutions11,1929676757145321,3309189423367,608Reverse repo, securities borrowing and margin lending-20,232544523-42850028612418922,826Loans and Advances59120,27225,99022,31816,21215,61344,95635,09355,561133,589370,195Securities&#39; portfolio settlement-7083,5663,6882,3014,31219,32010,01016,66251,472112,039Download tableMillions of EurosDecember 2016 - Contractual MaturitiesDemandUp to 1 Month1 to 3 Months3 to 6 Months6 to 9 Months9 to 12 Months1 to 2 Years2 to 3 Years3 to 5 YearsOver 5 YearsTotalWholesale funding4197,3802,9435,5473,4635,9677,8255,96314,01631,87585,397Deposits in financial institutions6,7625,3651,1812,1048002,1767461,1568593,71424,862Deposits in other financial institutions and international agencies15,3756,5428,6243,3822,5661,8971,3406868752,82544,114Customer deposits206,14049,05325,52215,73611,86311,3438,6195,060781936335,052Securitiy pledge funding-38,1533,5611,4031,0049121,28164023,9591,71272,626Derivatives (net)-(2,123)(95)(190)(111)(326)(132)(82)(105)(47)(3,210)Download tableMillions of EurosDecember 2015 - Contractual MaturitiesDemandUp to 1 Month1 to 3 Months3 to 6 Months6 to 9 Months9 to 12 Months1 to 2 Years2 to 3 Years3 to 5 YearsOver 5 YearsTotalCash, cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits34,796---------34,796Deposits in credit entities1,0774,594766260704252069503,98812,273Deposits in other financial institutions71,2464016285955264484959772755,600Reverse repo, securities borrowing and margin lending-12,3488535462012,323108412537016,859Loans and Advances1,36421,63925,62423,77716,75018,47740,51233,83554,790140,602377,371Securities&#39; portfolio settlement4842,0014,0147,0737,8354,12911,94414,72220,36659,755132,324Download tableMillions of EurosDecember 2015 - Contractual MaturitiesDemandUp to 1 Month1 to 3 Months3 to 6 Months6 to 9 Months9 to 12 Months1 to 2 Years2 to 3 Years3 to 5 YearsOver 5 YearsTotalWholesale funding75,1069,0935,7512,2225,16015,8567,84511,07233,84095,953Deposits in financial institutions4,9326,2712,0642,7839951,9522,3141,1101,2834,27027,975Deposits in other financial institutions and international agencies13,3808,9076,4942,9392,4422,21720512727436,877Customer deposits193,07929,00322,84615,98313,51713,75114,0764,6151,4471,190309,508Securitiy pledge funding-50,04211,1661,1974959662,25315,0451,8151,10384,081Derivatives (net)1(2,621)(208)(21)(253)(74)120(220)14(95)(3,357)Download tableThe matrix shows the retail nature of the funding structure, with a loan portfolio being mostly funded by customer deposits. On the outflows side of the matrix, the “demand” maturity bucket mainly contains the retail customers sight accounts whose behavior shows a high level of stability. According to internal methodology they are estimated to mature on average in more than three years.Long and short term wholesale funding markets were stable in 2016. The ECB carried out the new program Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO II), based on four quarterly targeted 4 years refinancing operations, with the aim of boosting channeled lending and improving financial conditions for the whole European economy. In the first auction the Euro LMU took €23.7 billion after amortizing €14 billion in previous TLTRO auctions. In addition, over the whole year the Euro LMU made issues in the public market for €6.350 million, which has allowed it to obtain funding at favorable price conditions.In Mexico, the liquidity position is still solid in spite of the market volatility after the US elections. Dependence on wholesale funding remains relatively low, where the good dynamics of customers funds have enabled a low appeal to wholesale markets, satisfied at the local market.In United States, the decrease in the credit gap during the year has diminished the need of wholesale funding, staying in a comfortable liquidity situation during 2016.In Turkey, despite geopolitical tension and downgrading of Moody’s credit rating, the domestic environment has remained stable, with no pressure on funding sources, favored by global stability and by the measures adopted by the Central Bank of Turkey (CBRT). The liquidity position of the rest of subsidiaries has continued to be comfortable, maintaining a solid liquidity position in all the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Access to capital markets of these subsidiaries has also been maintained with recurring issues in the local marketIn this context, BBVA has maintained its objective of strengthening the funding structure of the different Group entities based on growing their self-funding from stable customer funds, while guaranteeing a sufficient buffer of fully available liquid assets, diversifying the various sources of funding available, and optimizing the generation of collateral available for dealing with stress situations in the markets7.5.2 Asset encumbranceAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the encumbered (those provided as collateral for certain liabilities) and unencumbered assets are broken down as follows:Millions of EurosMillions of EurosEncumbered assetsDecember 2016Book value of EncumberedassetsMarket value of EncumberedassetsBook value of non encumbered assetsMarket value of non encumbered assets Equity instruments2,2142,2149,0229,022Debt securities40,11439,97290,67990,679Loans and Advances and other assets 94,718-495,109-Download tableMillions of EurosMillions of EurosEncumbered assetsDecember 2015Book value of EncumberedassetsMarket value of EncumberedassetsBook value of non encumbered assetsMarket value of non encumbered assets Equity instruments2,6802,6809,0469,046Debt securities56,15556,23095,66995,669Loans and Advances and other assets 100,139-486,165-Download tableThe committed value of “Loans and Advances and other assets” corresponds mainly to loans linked to the issue of covered bonds, territorial bonds or long-term securitized bonds (see Note 22.3) as well as those used as a guarantee to access certain funding transactions with central banks.

This definition includes legal risk but excludes strategic and/or business risk and reputational risk.Operational risk is inherent to all banking activities, products, systems and processes. Its origins are diverse (processes, internal and external fraud, technology, human resources, commercial practices, disasters, suppliers). Operational risk management is a part of the BBVA Group global risk management structure.Operational risk management frameworkOperational risk management in the Group is based on the value-adding drivers generated by the advanced measurement approach (AMA), as follows:Active management of operational risk and its integration into day-to-day decision-making means:Knowledge of the real losses associated with this type of risk.Identification, prioritization and management of real and potential risks.The existence of indicators that enable the Bank to analyze operational risk over time, define warning signals and verify the effectiveness of the controls associated with each risk.The above helps create a proactive model for making decisions about control and business, and for prioritizing the efforts to mitigate relevant risks in order to reduce the Group’s exposure to extreme events.Improved control environment and strengthened corporate culture.Generation of a positive reputational impact.Model based on three lines of defense, aligned with international best practices.Operational Risk Management PrinciplesOperational risk management in BBVA Group should:Be aligned with the risk appetite framework statement set out by the Board of BBVA.Anticipate the potential operational risks to which the Group would be exposed as a result of new or modified products, activities, processes, systems or outsourcing decisions, and establish procedures to enable their evaluation and reasonable mitigation prior to their implementation.Establish methodologies and procedures to enable a regular reassessment of the relevant operational risks to which the Group is exposed in order to adopt appropriate mitigation measures in each case, once the identified risk and the cost of mitigation (cost/benefit analysis) have been considered, while preserving the Group’s solvency at all times.Identify the causes of the operational losses sustained by the Group and establish measures to reduce them. Procedures must therefore be in place to enable the capture and analysis of the operational events that cause those losses.Analyze the events that have caused operational risk losses in other institutions in the financial sector and promote, where appropriate, the implementation of the measures needed to prevent them from occurring in the Group.Identify, analyze and quantify events with a low probability of occurrence and high impact in order to evaluate their mitigation. Due to their exceptional nature, it is possible that such events may not be included in the loss database or, if they are, they have impacts that are not representative.Have an effective system of governance in place, where the functions and responsibilities of the areas and bodies involved in operational risk management are clearly defined.These principles reflect BBVA Group’s vision of operational risk, on the basis that the resulting events have an ultimate cause that should always be identified, and that the impact of the events is reduced significantly by controlling that cause.Irrespective of the adoption of all the possible measures and controls for preventing or reducing both the frequency and severity of operational risk events, BBVA ensures at all times that sufficient capital is available to cover any expected or unexpected losses that may occur.7.7 Risk concentrationPolicies for preventing excessive risk concentrationIn order to prevent the build-up of excessive concentrations of credit risk at the individual, country and sector levels, BBVA Group maintains maximum permitted risk concentration indices updated at individual and portfolio sector levels tied to the various observable variables within the field of credit risk management.The limit on the Group’s exposure or financial commitment to a specific customer therefore depends on the customer’s credit rating, the nature of the risks involved, and the Group’s presence in a given market, based on the following guidelines:The aim is, as much as possible, to reconcile the customer’s credit needs (commercial/financial, shortterm/long-term, etc.) with the interests of the Group.Any legal limits that may exist concerning risk concentration are taken into account (relationship between risks with a customer and the capital of the shareholder´s entity that assumes them), the markets, the macroeconomic situation, etc.Risk concentrations by geographyThe breakdown of the main figures in the most significant foreign currencies in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is set forth in Appendix XII.Sovereign risk concentrationSovereign risk managementThe risk associated with the transactions involving sovereign risk is identified, measured, controlled and tracked by a centralized unit integrated in the BBVA Group’s Risk Area. Its basic functions involve the preparation of reports in the countries where sovereign risk exists (called “financial programs”), tracking such risks, assigning ratings to these countries and, in general, supporting the Group in terms of reporting requirements for any transactions involving sovereign risk. The risk policies established in the financial programs are approved by the relevant risk committees.The country risk unit tracks the evolution of the risks associated with the various countries to which the Group are exposed (including sovereign risk) on an ongoing basis in order to adapt its risk and mitigation policies to any macroeconomic and political changes that may occur. Moreover, it regularly updates its internal ratings and forecasts for these countries. The internal rating assignment methodology is based on the assessment of quantitative and qualitative parameters which are in line with those used by certain multilateral organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, rating agencies and export credit organizations.For additional information on sovereign risk in Europe see Appendix XIIValuation and impairment methodsThe valuation methods used to assess the instruments that are subject to sovereign risks are the same ones used for other instruments included in the relevant portfolios and are detailed in Note 8.Specifically, the fair value of sovereign debt securities of European countries has been considered equivalent to their listed price in active markets (Level 1 as defined in Note 8).CRisk related to the developer and Real-Estate sector in SpainOne of the main Group activities of the Group in Spain is focused on developer and mortgage loans. The policies and strategies established by the Group to deal with risks related to the developer and real-estate sector are explained below:Policies and strategies established by the Group to deal with risks related to the developer and real-estate sectorBBVA has teams specializing in the management of the Real-Estate Sector risk, given its economic importance and specific technical component. This specialization is not only in the Risk-Acceptance teams, but throughout the handling, commercial, problem risks and legal, etc. It also includes the research department of the BBVA Group (BBVA Research), which helps determine the medium/long-term vision needed to manage this portfolio. Specialization has been increased and the management teams in the areas of recovery and the Real Estate Unit itself have been reinforced.The policies established to address the risks related to the developer and real-estate sector, aim to accomplish, among others, the following objectives: to avoid concentration in terms of customers, products and regions; to estimate the risk profile for the portfolio; and to anticipate possible worsening of the portfolio.Specific policies for analysis and admission of new developer risk transactionsIn the analysis of new operations, the assessment of the commercial operation in terms of the economic and financial viability of the project has been one of the constant points that have helped ensure the success and transformation of construction land operations for customers’ developments.With regard the participation of the Risk Acceptance teams, they have a direct link and participate in the committees of areas such as Recoveries and the Real Estate Unit. This guarantees coordination and exchange of information in all the processes.The following strategies have been implemented with customers in the developer sector: avoidance of large corporate transactions, which had already reduced their share in the years of greatest market growth; non active participation in the second-home market; commitment to public housing financing; and participation in land operations with a high level of urban development security, giving priority to land open to urban development.Risk monitoring policiesThe base information for analyzing the real estate portfolios is updated monthly. The tools used include the socalled “watch-list”, which is updated monthly with the progress of each client under watch, and the different strategic plans for management of special groups. There are plans that involve an intensification of the review of the portfolio for financing land, while, in the case of ongoing promotions, they are classified based on the rate of progress of the projects.These actions have enabled BBVA to identify possible impairment situations, by always keeping an eye on BBVA’s position with each customer (whether or not as first creditor). In this regard, key aspects include management of the risk policy to be followed with each customer, contract review, deadline extension, improved collateral, rate review (repricing) and asset purchase.Proper management of the relationship with each customer requires knowledge of various aspects such as the identification of the source of payment difficulties, an analysis of the company’s future viability, the updating of the information on the debtor and the guarantors (their current situation and business course, economic-financial information, debt analysis and generation of funds), and the updating of the appraisal of the assets offered as collateral.BBVA has a classification of debtors in accordance with legislation in force in each country, usually categorizing each one’s level of difficulty for each risk.Based on the information above, a decision is made whether to use the refinancing tool, whose objective is to adjust the structure of the maturity of the debt to the generation of funds and the customer’s payment capacity.As for the policies relating to risk refinancing with the developer and real-estate sector, they are the same as the general policies used for all of the Group’s risks (see Note 7.3.6). In the developer and real estate sector, they are based on clear solvency and viability criteria for projects, with demanding terms for additional guarantees and legal compliance, given a refinancing tool that standardizes criteria and variables when considering any refinancing operation.In the case of refinancing, the tools used for enhancing the Bank’s position are: the search for new intervening parties with proven solvency and initial payment to reduce the principal debt or outstanding interest; the improvement of the debt bond in order to facilitate the procedure in the event of default; the provision of new or additional collateral; and making refinancing viable with new conditions (period, rate and repayments), adapted to a credible and sufficiently verified business plan.Policies applied in the management of real estate assets in SpainThe policy applied for managing these assets depends on the type of real-estate asset, as detailed below.In the case of completed homes, the final aim is the sale of these homes to private individuals, thus reducing the risk and beginning a new business cycle. Here, the strategy has been to help subrogation (the default rate in this channel of business is notably lower than in any other channel of residential mortgages) and to support customers’ sales directly, using BBVA’s own channel (BBVA Services and our branches), creating incentives for sale and including sale orders for BBVA. In exceptional case we have even accepted partial haircuts, with the aim of making the sale easier.In the case of ongoing home construction, the strategy has been to help and promote the completion of the construction in order to transfer the investment to completed homes. The whole developer Works in Progress portfolio has been reviewed and classified into different stages with the aim of using different tools to support the strategy. This includes the use of developer accounts-payable financing as a form of payment control, the use of project monitoring supported by the Real Estate Unit itself, and the management of direct suppliers for the works as a complement to the developer’s own management.With respect to land, the fact that the risk of rustic land is not significant simplifies the management. Urban management and liquidity control to tackle urban planning costs are also subject to special monitoring.For quantitative information about the risk related to the developer and Real-Estate sector in Spain see Appendix XII.8. Fair value8.1 Fair value of financial instrumentThe fair value of financial instrument is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It is therefore a market-based measurement and not specific to each entity.All financial instruments, both assets and liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, which at that point is equivalent to the transaction price, unless there is evidence to the contrary in the market. Subsequently, depending on the type of financial instrument, it may continue to be recognized at amortized cost or fair value through adjustments in the income statement or equity.When possible, the fair value is determined as the market price of a financial instrument. However, for many of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group, especially in the case of derivatives, there is no market price available, so its fair value is estimated on the basis of the price established in recent transactions involving similar instruments or, in the absence thereof, by using mathematical measurement models that are sufficiently tried and trusted by the international financial community. The estimates of the fair value derived from the use of such models take into consideration the specific features of the asset or liability to be measured and, in particular, the various types of risk associated with the asset or liability. However, the limitations inherent in the measurement models and possible inaccuracies in the assumptions and parameters required by these models may mean that the estimated fair value of an asset or liability does not exactly match the price for which the asset or liability could be exchanged or settled on the date of its measurement.The process for determining the fair value established in the Group to ensure that trading portfolio assets are properly valued, BBVA has established, at a geographic level, a structure of New Product Committees responsible for validating and approving new products or types of financial assets and liabilities before being contracted. The members of these Committees, responsible for valuation, are independent from the business (see Note 7).These areas are required to ensure, prior to the approval stage, the existence of not only technical and human resources, but also adequate informational sources to measure the fair value these financial assets and liabilities, in accordance with the rules established by the Global Valuation Area and using models that have been validated and approved by the Risk Analytics Department that reports to Global Risk Management.Additionally, for financial assets and liabilities that show significant uncertainty in inputs or model parameters used for assessment, criteria is established to measure said uncertainty and activity limits are set based on these. Finally, these measurements are compared, as much as possible, against other sources such as the measurements obtained by the business teams or those obtained by other market participants.The process for determining the fair value requires the classification of the financial assets and liabilities according to the measurement processes used as set forth below:Level 1: Measurement using market observable quoted prices for the financial instrument in question, secured from independent sources and trading in referred to active markets - according to the Group policies. This level includes listed debt securities, listed equity instruments, some derivatives and mutual funds.Level 2: Measurement that applies techniques using inputs drawn from observable market data.Level 3: Measurement using techniques where some of the material inputs are not derived from market observable data. As of December 31, 2016, the affected instruments accounted for approximately 0.12% of financial assets and 0,02% of the Group’s financial liabilities registered at fair value. Model selection and validation is undertaken by control areas outside the market units.Below is a comparison of the carrying amount of the Group’s financial instruments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and their respective fair values.Millions of Euros201620152014Fair Value and Carrying AmountNotesCarrying AmountFair ValueCarrying AmountFair ValueCarrying AmountFair

assessment of the main financial instruments classified in Level 3, and its main unobservable inputs, are described below:The net present value (net present value method): This technique uses the future cash flows of each debt security, which are established in the different contracts, and discounted to their present value. This technique often includes many observable inputs, but may also include unobservable inputs, as described below.Credit Spread: This input represents the difference in yield of a debt security and the reference rate, reflecting the additional return that a market participant would require to take the credit risk of that debt security. Therefore, the credit spread of the debt security is part of the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the future cash flows.Recovery rate: This input represents the percentage of principal and interest recovered from a debt instrument that has defaulted.Comparable prices (similar asset prices): This input represents the prices of comparable financial instruments and benchmarks are used to calculate its yield from the entry price or current rating making further adjustments to account for differences that may exist between financial instrument being valued and the comparable financial instrument. It can also be assumed that the price of the financial instrument is equivalent to the other.Net asset value: This input represents the total value of the financial assets and liabilities of a fund and is published by the fund manager thereof.Gaussian copula: This input is dependent on credit instruments referenced by the CDS, the joint density function to integrate to value is constructed by a Gaussian copula that relates the marginal densities by a normal distribution, usually extracted from the correlation matrix of events approaching default by CDS issuers.Black 76: variant of Black Scholes model, which main application is the valuation of bond options, cap floors and swaptions to directly model the behavior of the Forward and not the Spot itself.Heston: This model, typically applied to equity OTC options, assumes stochastic behavior of volatility. According to which, the volatility follows a process that reverts to a long-term level and is correlated with the underlying equity instrument. As opposed to local volatility models, in which the volatility evolves deterministically, the Heston model is more flexible, allowing it to be similar to that observed in the short term today.Libor market model: This model assumes that the dynamics of the interest rate curve can be modeled based on the set of forward contracts that compose the interest rate option. The correlation matrix is parameterized on the assumption that the correlation between any two forward contracts decreases at a constant rate, beta, to the extent of the difference in their respective due dates. The input “Credit default volatility” is a volatility input of the credit factor dynamic. The multifactorial frame of this model makes it ideal for the valuation of instruments sensitive to the slope or curve, including interest rate option.Adjustments to the valuation for risk of defaultThe credit valuation adjustments (“CVA”) and debit valuation adjustments (“DVA”) are a part of derivative instrument valuations, both financial assets and liabilities, to reflect the impact in the fair value of the credit risk of the counterparty and its own, respectively.These adjustments are calculated by estimating Exposure At Default, Probability of Default and Loss Given Default, for all derivative products on any instrument at the legal entity level (all counterparties under a same ISDA / CMOF) in which BBVA has exposure.As a general rule, the calculation of CVA is done through simulations of market and credit variables to calculate the expected positive exposure, given the Exposure at Default and multiplying the result by the Loss Given Default of the counterparty. Consequently, the DVA is calculated as the result of the expected negative exposure given the Exposure at Default and multiplying the result by the Loss Given Default of the counterparty. Both calculations are performed throughout the entire period of potential exposure.The information needed to calculate the exposure at default and the loss given default come from the credit markets (Credit Default Swaps or iTraxx Indexes), where rating is available. For those cases where the rating is not available, BBVA implements a mapping process based on the sector, rating and geography to assign probabilities of both probability of default and loss given default, calibrated directly to market or with an adjustment market factor for the probability of default and the historical expected loss.The amounts recognized in the Consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 related to the valuation adjustments to the credit assessment of the derivative asset as “Credit Valuation Adjustments” (“CVA”) and the derivative liabilities were -€275 million and €291 million respectively. The impact recorded under “Gains or (-) losses on financial assets and liabilities held for trading, net” in the consolidated income statement as of 2016 and 2015 corresponding to the mentioned adjustments was a net impact of €46 million and €109 million respectively.Financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 3El movimiento de los saldos de los activos y pasivos financieros clasificados en el Nivel 3 que figuran en los balances consolidados adjuntos, se muestra a continuación:Millions of Euros201620152014Financial Assets Level 3.

(**) Of which, in 2016, the assets roll forward is comprised of €849 million of acquisitions, €340 millions of disposals and €71 millions of liquidations. The liabilities roll forward is comprised of €47 million of acquisitions and €70 million of disposals y 3 millions of liquidations.As of December 31, 2016, the profit/loss on sales of financial instruments classified as Level 3 recognized in the accompanying income statement was not material.Transfers between levelsThe Global Valuation Area, in collaboration with the Technology and Methodology Area, has established the rules for a proper financials assets held for trading classification according to the fair value hierarchy defined by international accounting standards.On a monthly basis, any new assets added to the portfolio are classified, according to this criterion, by the accounting subsidiary. Then, there is a quarterly review of the portfolio in order to analyze the need for a change in classification of any of these assets.The financial instruments transferred between the different levels of measurement for the year ended December 31, 2016 are at the following amounts in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016:Millions of EurosDE:Level ILevel 2Level 3Traspasos de nivelesA:Level 2Level 3Level 1Level 3Level 1Level 2ASSETS&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Financial assets held for trading &amp;nbsp;211925--Available-for-sale financial assets&amp;nbsp;56-25910--Total&amp;nbsp;58145115--LIABILITIES&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Financial liabilities held for trading &amp;nbsp;5-----Total&amp;nbsp;5-----Download tableThe amount of financial instruments that were transferred between levels of valuation for the year ended December 31, 2016 is not material relative to the total portfolios, basically corresponding to the above revisions of the classification between levels because these financial instruments had modified some of its features. Specifically:The transfers between Level 1 and 2 represents debt securities, which are either no longer listed on an active market (transfer from Level 1 to 2) or are just starting to be listed (transfer from Level 2 to 1).The transfers from Level 2 to Level 3 are due mainly to equity instruments and debt securities for which observable inputs are not available.Sensitivity AnalysisSensitivity analysis is performed on financial instruments with significant unobservable inputs (financial instruments included in level 3), in order to obtain a reasonable range of possible alternative valuations. This analysis is carried out on a monthly basis, based on the criteria defined by the Global Valuation Area taking into account the nature of the methods used for the assessment and the reliability and availability of inputs and proxies used. In order to establish, with a sufficient degree of certainty, the valuating risk that is incurred in such assets without applying diversification criteria between them.As of December 31, 2016, the effect on profit for the period and total equity of changing the main unobservable inputs used for the measurement of Level 3 financial instruments for other reasonably possible unobservable inputs, taking the highest (most favorable input) or lowest (least favorable input) value of the range deemed probable, would be as follows:Millions of EurosPotential Impact on Consolidated Income Statement Potential Impact on Total Equity Financial Assets Level 3.

Additionally, factors such as prepayment rates and correlations of default are taken into account.The following table presents the fair value of key financial instruments carried at amortized cost in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, broken down according to the method of valuation used for the estimation:Millions of Euros201620152014Fair Value of financial Instruments at amortized cost by LevelsNotesLevel 1Level 2Level 3Level 1Level 2Level 3Level 1Level 2Level 3ASSETS-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cash and cash balances at central banks939,373-66628,961-32227,719--Loans and receivables13-10,991457,853-7,681472,858-3,046374,063Held-to-maturity investments1417,5671141------LIABILITIES-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Financial liabilities at amortized cost22--594,190--613,247--486,904Download tableThe main valuation techniques and inputs used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments accounted for at cost and classified in levels 2 and 3 is shown below.

On the above dates, the balances of these financial instruments recognized in the portfolio of available-for-sale financial assets amounted to €565 million, €600 million and €540 million, respectively.The table below outlines the financial instruments carried at cost that were sold in the six months period ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:Millions of EurosSales of Financial Instruments at Cost201620152014Amount of Sale (A)2013371Carrying Amount at Sale Date(B)582221Gains/Losses (A-B)14211508.2 Assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basisAs indicated in Note 2.2.4, non-current assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their fair value less costs to sell and its carrying amount. As of December, 2016 nearly the entire book value of the non-current assets held for sale from foreclosures or recoveries approximate their fair value (see Note 20 and 21).The global valuation of the portfolio of assets has been carried out using a statistical methodology based on real estate and local macroeconomic variables.Valuation standardsThe overall rating of the portfolio of assets has been carried out using a statistical methodology based on real estate and local macroeconomic variables.The details of each property which has been based each of the assessments are specified in the data sheet valuation of each asset.Valuation MethodologyOverall valuation of real estate assets portfolioThe overall valuation of the portfolio of real estate assets as of December 31, 2016 was performed from the latest appraisal values available. This value was corrected based on the following:Analysis of the property sales performed during the year and comparison of the value to sell these properties to the appraisal values obtained most recently. From this analysis derived a conclusion by type of property and location.Individual valuation of a material sample of the entire portfolio considering type of properties. The results obtained from these valuations have been compared with the adjusted values of the above analysis, obtaining a second conclusion by type and location.Individual valuation of real estate assets sampleThe basic methods used in the valuation were as follows:Comparative Market Method: the property under study is compared with others of similar characteristics which have been recently sold or are for sale on the market, making a comparative analysis, making adjustments due to factors that can cause differences, such as location, size, dimensions, shape, topography, access, urban classification, type of construction, age, storage, distribution, function, or design.Dynamic Residual Method (DRM): this is considered the most accurate method to conduct an appraisal of the poorly developed or undeveloped land, where there is minimal planning (use and a gross floor area) or a more defined development planning, since in these cases the market is often not very transparent. It starts from the consideration that the development and sale of finished real estate product is conceived from the beginning as a business project, as such it involves a risk, taking place in a time frame in which an initial capital investment occurs generating income and expenses. As such business project, the goal is to maximize profits and therefore the principle of highest and best use.Yield Method (DCF): the value of assets is determined by the profits that they could generate in the future (projections) discounted at an appropriate rate of discount. This is an overall assessment, reflecting the economic potential and profitabilityTo calculate the value, once the market conditions have been analyzed, the following factors are taken into consideration:Size, location, and type of property.Current condition of the property market, sales price trends and rental competition in the real estate market or industry risk, adjusted based on the statistical information of local real estate and macroeconomic variables.The fullest and best use of the asset, which must be legally allowed, physically possible, economically viable, and provide the maximum possible value, supported in economic terms. Analysis of the fullest and best use contemplates its current condition, whether free and available, based on the mentioned appraisals.Market Value of the property, considering this as vacant and available for use, analyzing factors such as location, size, physical characteristics, similar transactions and value adjustments proposed by the current economic conditions.Valuation CriteriaReal estate properties have been appraised individually considering a hypothetical stand-alone sale and not as part of a real estate portfolio type of sale.The portfolio of Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale by type of asset and inventories as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is provided below by hierarchy of fair value measurements:Millions of Euros201620152014Fair Value at Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale and inventories by levels NotesLevel 2Level 3TotalLevel 2Level 3TotalLevel 2Level 3TotalNon-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale21&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Housing&amp;nbsp;2,0593012,3602,192982,2912,04592,054Oficinas, locales, naves y resto&amp;nbsp;326105431353534063998407Land&amp;nbsp;-15015012236248-237237TOTAL&amp;nbsp;2,3855562,9412,5573882,9452,4442552,699Inventories20&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Housing&amp;nbsp;903-9031,452-1,4521,424-1,424Offices, warehouses and other&amp;nbsp;620-620647-647628-628Land&amp;nbsp;-1,5911,591-2,0562,056-2,1692,169TOTAL&amp;nbsp;1,5231,5913,1142,0992,0564,1552,0522,1694,221Download tableSince the amount classified in Level 3 (€2,147 million) is not significant compared to the total consolidated assets and that the inputs used in the valuation (DRM or DFC), are very diverse based on the type and geographic location (being the typical ones used in the valuation of real estate assets of this type), they have not been disclosed.9.

impairment on financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss- Available- for-sale financial assets” in the accompanying consolidated income statement amounted to €157 million (Note 47). In 2015 and 2014 the losses recognized were not significant (€1 and €19 million respectively).For the rest of debt securities, the 92.2% of the unrealized losses recognized under the heading “Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss– Available-for-sale financial assets” and originating in debt securities were generated over more than twelve months. However, no impairment was recognized, as following an analysis of these unrealized losses we concluded that they were temporary due to the following reasons: the interest payment dates of all the fixed-income securities have been satisfied; and because there is no evidence that the issuer will not continue to meet its payment obligations, nor that future payments of both principal and interest will not be sufficient to recover the cost of the debt securities.The losses recognized, for equity instruments Available-for-Sale, under the heading “Impairment or reversal of impairment on financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss - Available- for-sale financial assets” in the accompanying consolidated income statement amounted to €46, €23 and €17 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively (see Note 47).As of December 31, 2016, the Group has analyzed the unrealized losses recognized under the heading “Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss– Available-for-sale financial assets” resulting from equity instruments generated over a period of more than 12 months and with a fall of more 20% in their price, as a first approximation to the existence of possible impairment. As of 31 December, 2016, the unrealized losses recognized under the heading “Accumulated other comprehensive income - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss– Available-for-sale financial assets” resulting from equity instruments generated over a period of more than 18 months or with a fall of more 40% in their price are not significant in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.13.

This analysis is performed at least annually and whenever there is any indication of impairment.Both the CGU’s fair values in the United States and the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities had been based on the estimates and assumptions that the Group’s Management has deemed most likely given the circumstances. However, some changes to the valuation assumptions used could result in differences in the impairment test result.Three key hypotheses are used when calculating the impairment test. They those to which the amount of the recoverable value is most sensitive:The forecast cash flows estimated by the Group’s management, and based on the latest available budgets for the next 5 years.The constant sustainable growth rate for extrapolating cash flows, starting in the fifth year (2021), beyond the period covered by the budgets or forecasts.The discount rate on future cash flows, which coincides with the cost of capital assigned to each CGU, and which consists of a risk-free rate plus a premium that reflects the inherent risk of each of the businesses evaluated.The focus used by the Group’s management to determine the values of the hypotheses is based both on its projections and past experience. These values are uniform and use external sources of information. At the same time, the valuations of the most significant goodwill have in general been reviewed by independent experts (not the Group’s external auditors) who apply different valuation methods according to each type of asset and liability. The valuation methods used are: The method for calculating the discounted value of future cash flows, the market transaction method and the cost method.As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, no indicators of impairment have been identified in any of the main CGUs.The Group’s most significant goodwill corresponds to the CGU in the United States, the main significant hypotheses used in the impairment test of this mentioned CGU are:Impairment test hypotheses CGU Goodwill in the United States201620152014Discount rate10.0%9.8%10.0%Sustainable growth rate4.0%4.0%4.0%Download tableGiven the potential growth of the sector, in accordance with paragraph 33 of IAS 36, as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 the Group used a steady growth rate of 4% based on the real GDP growth rate of the United States and expected inflation. This 4% rate is less than the historical average of the past 30 years of the nominal GDP rate of the United States and lower than the real GDP growth forecasted by the IMF.The assumptions with a greater relative weight and whose volatility could affect more in determining the present value of the cash flows starting on the fifth year are the discount rate and the growth rate. Below is shown the increased (or decreased) amount of the recoverable amount as a result of a reasonable variation (in basic points) of each of the key assumptions:Millions of EurosSensitivity analysis for main hypothesesImpact of an increase of 50 basis points (*)Impact of a decrease of 50 basis points (*)Discount rate(1,106)1,309Sustainable growth rate521(441)Download table(*) Based on historical changes, the use of 50 basis points to calculate the sensitivity analysis would be a reasonable variation with respect to the observed variations over the last five years (36 basis points).Another assumption used, and with a high impact on the impairment test, is the budgets of the CGU and specifically the effect that changes in interest rates have on cash flows. The rise in interest rates in December 2016 and the expected rise in interest rates in 2017, net interest income would be positively affected and, therefore, the recoverable amount of the CGU would increase.Goodwill in business combinations 2016There were no significant business combinationsGoodwill in business combinations 2015Catalunya BancAs stated in Note 3, in the six month ended June 30, 2015 the Group acquired 98.4% of the share capital of the Catalunya Banc.Shown below are details of the carrying amount of the consolidated assets and liabilities of Catalunya Banc prior to its acquisition and the corresponding fair values, gross of tax, which have been estimated in accordance with the IFRS-3 acquisition method.Millions of EurosValuation and calculation of badwill for the acquisition of stake in Catalunya BancCarrying AmountFair ValueAcquisition cost (A) -1,165 Cash on hand616 616 Financial assets held for trading 341 341 Available-for-sale financial assets1,845 1,853 Loans and receivables 37,509 36,766 Held-to-maturity investments (*)--Fair value changes of the hedged items in portfolio hedge of interest rate risk 23 23 Derivatives – Hedge accounting845 845 Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale274 193 Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates 209 293 Tangible assets908 626 &amp;gt;Intangible assets 7 129 Other assets581 498 Financial Liabilities Held for Trading (332)(332)Financial liabilities at Amortized Cost(41,271)(41,501)Fair value changes of the hedged items in portfolio hedge of interest rate risk (490)(490)Derivatives – Hedge accounting(535)(535)Provisions(1,248)(1,667)Other liabilities(84)(84)Deferred tax3,312 3,630 Total fair value of assets and liabilities acquiered (B)-1,205Non controlling Interest Grupo Catalunya Banc (**) (C)22Non controlling Interest after purchase (D)-12Badwill (A)-(B)+(C )+(D)-(26)Download table(*) After the purchase, it has been reclassified under the heading “Available-for-sale financial assets” (**) It corresponds to non-controlling interests that Catalunya Banc held, prior to integration in the BBVA Group.Because the resulting goodwill was negative, the net fair value of identifiable assets acquired and lesser liabilities assumed was initially estimated as of June 30, 2015 in an amount of 22 million euros but subsequently the calculation was modified to 26 million euros a gain was recognized in the accompanying consolidated income statement for 2015 under the heading “Badwill” (see Note 2.2.7).The calculation of this amount was subject to change, since the estimate of all the fair values has been reviewed and, according to IFRS-3, they may be modified during a period of one year from the acquisition date (April 2015).

Tax assets and liabilities19.1 Consolidated tax groupPursuant to current legislation, the BBVA Consolidated Tax Group includes the Bank (as the parent company) and its Spanish subsidiaries that meet the requirements provided for under Spanish legislation regulating the taxation regime for the consolidated profit of corporate groups.The Group’s non-Spanish other banks and subsidiaries file tax returns in accordance with the tax legislation in force in each country.19.2Years open for review by the tax authoritiesThe years open to review in the BBVA Consolidated Tax Group as of December 31, 2016 are 2010 and subsequent years for the main taxes applicable.The remainders of the Spanish consolidated entities in general have the last four years open for inspection by the tax authorities for the main taxes applicable, except for those in which there has been an interruption of the limitation period due to the start of an inspection.In the year 2014 as a consequence of the tax authorities examination reviews, inspections were initiated until the year 2009 inclusive, all of them signed in acceptance during the year 2014.In view of the varying interpretations that can be made of some applicable tax legislation, the outcome of the tax inspections of the open years that could be conducted by the tax authorities in the future could give rise to contingent tax liabilities which cannot be reasonably estimated at the present time. However, the Group considers that the possibility of these contingent liabilities becoming actual liabilities is remote and, in any case, the tax charge which might arise therefore would not materially affect the Group’s accompanying consolidated financial statements.19.3 ReconciliationThe reconciliation of the Group’s corporate income tax expense resulting from the application of the Spanish corporation income tax rate and the income tax expense recognized in the accompanying consolidated income statements is as follows:Millions of Euros201620152014Reconciliation of Taxation at the Spanish Corporation Tax Rate to the Tax Expense Recorded for the PeriodAmountEffective Tax%AmountEffective Tax%AmountEffective Tax%Profit or (-) loss before tax6,392&amp;nbsp;4,603&amp;nbsp;3,980&amp;nbsp;From continuing operations6,392&amp;nbsp;4,603&amp;nbsp;3,980&amp;nbsp;From discontinued operations&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Taxation at Spanish corporation tax rate 30%1,918&amp;nbsp;1,381&amp;nbsp;1,194&amp;nbsp;Lower effective tax rate from foreign entities(*)(298)&amp;nbsp;(221)&amp;nbsp;(318)&amp;nbsp;Mexico(105)26%(149)25%(145)24%Chile(27)17%(28)18%(71)-8%Colombia2236%230%230%Peru(18)26%(13)28%(12)28%Other6&amp;nbsp;(33)&amp;nbsp;(92)&amp;nbsp;Revenues with lower tax rate (dividends)(69)&amp;nbsp;(65)&amp;nbsp;(88)&amp;nbsp;Equity accounted earning(11)&amp;nbsp;(74)&amp;nbsp;(147)&amp;nbsp;Other effects159&amp;nbsp;253&amp;nbsp;257&amp;nbsp;Current income tax1,699&amp;nbsp;1,274&amp;nbsp;898&amp;nbsp;Of which:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Continuing operations1,699&amp;nbsp;1,274&amp;nbsp;898&amp;nbsp;Discontinued operations-&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;-Download table(*) Calculated by applying the difference between the tax rate in force in Spain and the one applied to the Group’s earnings in each jurisdiction.The effective income tax rate for the Group in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:Millions of EurosEffective Tax Rate201620152014Income from:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Consolidated Tax Group(483)(1,426)(997) Other Spanish Entities5210718 Foreign Entities6,8235,9224,959Total 6,3924,6033,980Income tax and other taxes1,6991,274898Effective Tax Rate26.58%27.68%22.56%Download table19.4Income tax recognized in equityIn addition to the income tax expense recognized in the accompanying consolidated income statements, the Group has recognized the following income tax charges for these items in the consolidated total equity:Millions of EurosTax recognized in total equity201620152014Charges to total equityy&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Debt securities(533)(593)(953)Equity instruments(2)113(188)Subtotal(535)(480)(1,141)Total(535)(480)(1,141)19.5Deferred taxesThe balance under the heading “Tax assets” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets includes deferred tax assets.

Mexico: Net deferred tax assets recognized in Mexico amounted to €698 million as of December 31, 2016 (€608 and €399 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014). 99.96% of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016 relate to temporary differences. The remainders are tax credits carry forwards.South America: Net deferred tax assets recognized in South America amounted to €362 million as of December 31, 2016 (€330 and €364 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014).

Liabilities under reinsurance and insurance contractsThe Group has insurance subsidiaries mainly in Spain and Latin America (mostly in Mexico). The main product offered by the insurance subsidiaries is life insurance to cover the risk of death (risk insurance) and life-savings insurance. Within life and accident insurance, a distinction is made between freely sold products and those offered to customers who have taken mortgage or consumer loans, which cover the principal of those loans in the event of the customer’s death.There are two types of life-saving insurance products: individual insurance, which seeks to provide the customer with savings for retirement or other events, and group insurance, which is taken out by employers to cover their commitments to their employees.The insurance business is affected by different risks, including those that are related to the BBVA Group such as credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and operational risk and the methodology for risk measurement applied in the insurance activity is similar (see Note 7), although it has a differentiated management due to the particular characteristics of the insurance business, such as the coverage of contracted obligations and the long term of the commitments. Additionally, the insurance business generates certain specific risks, of a probabilistic nature:Technical risk: arises from deviations in the estimation of the casualty rate of insurances, either in terms of numbers, the amount of such claims and the timing of its occurrence.Biometric risk: depending on the deviations in the expected mortality behavior or the survival of the insured persons.The insurance industry is highly regulated in each country. In this regard, it should be noted that the insurance industry is undergoing a gradual regulatory transformation through new capital regulations risk-based, which have already been published in several countries.The most significant provisions recognized by consolidated insurance subsidiaries with respect to insurance policies issued by them are under the heading “Liabilities under “Insurance and reinsurance contracts” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.The breakdown of the balance under this heading is as follows:Millions of EurosTechnical Reserves by type of insurance product201620152014Mathematical reserves7,8138,1019,352Individual life insurance (1)4,7914,2945,683Savings3,9433,7565,073Risk848526610Other -12-Group insurance (2)3,0223,8073,669 Savings2,8013,3453,207Risk221462462Other -- -Provision for unpaid claims reported691697578Provisions for unexpired risks and other provisions635609529Total 9,1399,40710,460Download table(1) Provides coverage in the event of death or disability.

The most important insurance entities are located in Spain and Mexico (which together account for approximately 96% of the insurance revenues), where the modeling methods and techniques are reviewed by the insurance regulator in Spain (General Directorate of Insurance) and Mexico (National Insurance and Bonding Commission), respectively. The modeling methods and techniques used to calculate the mathematical reserves for the insurance products are based on IFRS and primarily involve the valuation of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the technical interest rate for each policy. To ensure this technical interest rate, asset-liability management is carried out, acquiring a portfolio of securities that generate the cash flows needed to cover the payment commitments assumed with the customers.The table below shows the key assumptions used in the calculation of the mathematical reserves for insurance products in Spain and Mexico, respectively:Mortality table Average technical interest typeMathematical ReservesSpainMexicoSpainMexicoSIndividual life insurance (1)&quot;GKMF80 PASEM/95%PASEM HombreOwn tables&quot;Tables of the Comision Nacional De Seguros y Fianzas 2000-individual1.15%-3.00%2.5%Group insurance(2)PERMF2000//Own tablesTables of the Comision Nacional De Seguros y Fianzas 2000-group1.37%-3.00%5.5%Download table(1) Provides coverage in the case of one or more of the following events: death and disability.

According to the procedural status of these proceedings and the criteria of the legal counsel, BBVA considers that, except for the proceeding mentioned below, none of such actions is material, individually or as a whole, and with no significant impact on the operating results, liquidity or financial situation at a consolidated or individual level of the Bank. The Group´s Management believes that the provisions made in respect of such legal proceedings are adequate.Regarding the consequences of the invalidity of the clauses of limitation of interest rates in mortgage loans with consumers (the so-called “cláusulas suelo”) the legal situation is as follows:The Spanish Supreme Court, in a judgment dated May 9, 2013, rendered on a collective claim against BBVA among others, and that is definitive, resolved unanimously that those clauses should be deemed as invalid if they did not comply with certain requirements of material transparency set forth in the referred judgment. In addition, that judgment determined that there were no grounds for the refund of the amounts collected pursuant to those clauses before May 9, 2013.As communicated to the market by means of Relevant Event dated June 12, 2013, BBVA ceased to apply, in execution of that judgment, as from May 9, 2013, the “cláusula suelo” in all mortgage loan agreements with consumers in which it had been included.In an individual claim, the Provincial Court of Alicante raised a preliminary ruling to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), for the CJEU to determine if the time limitation for the refund of the amounts set forth by the Supreme Court complies with Directive 93/13/EEC. On July 13, the opinion of the Advocate-General of the CJEU was published and in its conclusions it stated that the European directive did not oppose to a Member State’s Supreme Court limiting, due to exceptional circumstances, the restorative effects of the invalidity to the date on which its first judgment in this regard was issued.Last December 21, the CJEU published its sentence that decided the preliminary ruling raised by the Provincial Court of Alicante and other national judicial bodies, in the sense that the Supreme Court’s case law that limited in time the restorative effects related to the unfair declaration of a clause included in an agreement between a consumer and a professional is contrary to Article 6.1 of Directive 93/13/EEC on unfair terms in consumer contracts.After the mentioned CJEU’s decision, BBVA has made, once analyzed the portfolio of mortgage loans to consumers, in which the “cláusulas suelo” have applied, a provision of €577 million (with an impact on the attributed profit of approximately €404 million, as communicated to the market in the Relevant Event dated December 21, 2016), to cover future claims that could be filed.25. Post-employment and other employee benefit commitmentsAs stated in Note 2.2.12, the Group has assumed commitments with employees including short-term employee benefits, defined contribution and defined benefit plans (see Note 44.1), healthcare and other long-term employee benefits.The Group sponsors defined-contribution plans for the majority of its active employees with the plans in Spain and Mexico being the most significant. Most defined benefit plans are closed to new employees and with liabilities relating largely to retired employees, the most significant being those in Spain, Mexico, the United States and Turkey. In Mexico, the Group provides medical benefits to a closed group of employees and their family members, both active service and in retirement.The breakdown of the balance sheet net defined benefit liability as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is provided below:Millions of EurosNet Defined Benefit Liability (asset) on the Balance Sheet201620152014Pension commitments5,2775,3064,737Early retirement commitments2,5592,8552,803Medical benefits commitments1,0151,0231,083Other long term employee benefits696862Total commitments8,9209,2528,685Pension plan assets1,9091,9741,697Medical benefit plan assets1,1131,1491,240Total plan assets (*)3,0223,1242,937Total net liability / asset on the balance sheet5,8986,1285,748Of which: Net asset on the balance sheet (**)(194)(238)(285)Net liability on the balance sheetfor provisions for pensions and similar obligations (***)6,0256,2995,970Net liability on the balance sheetfor other long term employee benefits (****)696862Download table(*) In Turkey, the foundation responsible for managing the benefit commitments holds an additional asset of €257 million which, in accordance with IFRS regarding the asset ceiling, has not been recognized in the accounts, because although it could be used to reduce future pension contributions it could not be immediately refunded to the employer.

The remaining commitments are located mostly in Portugal and South America. Unless otherwise required by local regulation, all defined benefit plans have been closed to new entrants, who instead are able to participate in the Group´s defined contribution plans. Both the costs and the present value of the commitments are determined by independent qualified actuaries using the “projected unit credit” method.In order to guarantee the good governance of these plans, the Group has established specific benefits committees. These benefit committees include members from the different areas of the business to ensure that all decisions are made taking into consideration all of the associated impacts. Both the costs and the present value of the commitments are determined by independent qualified actuaries using the “projected unit credit” method.The following table sets out the key actuarial assumptions used in the valuation of these commitments:201620152014Actuarial AssumptionsSpainMexicoUSATurkeySpainMexicoUSATurkeySpainMexicoUSADiscount rate1.50%9.95%4.04%11.50%2.00%9.30%4.30%10.30%2.25%8.75%3.97%Rate of salary increase1.50%4.75%3.00%9.30%2.00%4.75%3.00%8.60%2.00%4.75%3.25%Rate of pension increase-2.13%-7.80%&amp;nbsp;2.13%&amp;nbsp;7.10%&amp;nbsp;2.13%2.25%Medical cost trend rate-6.75%-10.92%&amp;nbsp;6.75%&amp;nbsp;9.94%&amp;nbsp;6.75%8.00%Mortality tablesPERM/F 2000PEMSSA97 (adjustment EMSSA09)RP 2014CSO2001PERM/F 2000PEMSSA 97RP 2014CSO2001PERM/F 2000PEMSSA 97RP 2014Download tableDiscount rates used to value future benefit cash flows have been determined by reference to high quality corporate bonds (Note 2.2.12) in Euro in the case of Spain, Mexican peso for Mexico and USD for the United States), and government bonds in new Turkish Lira for Turkey.The expected return on plan assets has been set in line with the adopted discount rate.Assumed retirement ages have been set by reference to the earliest age at which employees are entitled to retire, the contractually agreed age in the case of early retirements in Spain or by using retirement rates.Changes in the main actuarial assumptions may affect the valuation of the commitments.

These include long-service awards, which consist of either an established monetary award or some vacation days granted to certain groups of employees when they complete a given number of years of service. As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 the actuarial liabilities for the outstanding awards amounted to €69 million, €68 million and €62 million, respectively. These commitments are recorded under the heading “Provisions - Other long-term employee benefits” of the accompanying consolidated balance sheet (see Note 24).As described above, the Group maintains both pension and medical post-employment benefit commitments with their employees.Post-employment commitments and similar obligationsThese pension commitments relate mostly to pensions where the employees are already receiving payment, and which have been determined based on salary and years of service in accordance with the specific plan rules. For most plans pension payments are due on retirement, death and long term disability.In addition, during the year 2016, Group entities in Spain offered certain employees the option to take early retirement (that is, earlier than the age stipulated in the collective labor agreement in force). This offer was accepted by 613 (1,817 and 1,706 during years 2015 and 2014, respectively). These commitments include both the compensation and indemnities due as well as the contributions payable to external pension funds during the early retirement period. As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 the value of these commitments amounted to €2,559 million, €2,855 million and €2,803 respectively.Millions of EurosNet Liability (asset)Defined Benefit ObligationSpainMexicoUSATurkeyRest of the worldBalance at the beginning6,109(79)359724Current service cost1064225Interest income or expense98(7)182Contributions by plan participants----0Employer contributions -(14)(1)(17)(9)Past service costs(1)2401-4(4)Remeasurements:1882310811 Return on plan assets (2)(35)233(23)(23) From changes in demographic assumptions-2(5)-(1) From changes in financial assumptions192(22)13(23)37 Other actuarial gain and losses3119(1)54(2) Benefit payments(867)-(3)(9)(2)Settlement payments(43)----Business combinations and disposal-----Effect on changes in foreign exchange rates-102(15)(4)Othereffects63-(3)-20Balance at the end5,799(59)469942Of which:Vested benefit obligation relating to current employees161Vested benefit obligation relating to retired employees5,996Download tableMillions of EurosPlan AssetsPost-employment commitments2016SpainMexicoUnited StatesTurkeyRestoBalance at the beginning380596329337333Current service cost-----Interest income or expense74913339Contributions by plan participants---41Employer contributions -141179Past service costs(1)-----Remeasurements:35(23)(3)2323 Return on plan assets(2)35(23)(3)2323 From changes in demographic assumptions----- From changes in financial assumptions----- Other actuarial gain and losses---- -Benefit payments(64)(40)(13)(12)(9)Settlement payments -----Business combinations and disposal-----Effect on changes in foreign exchange rates-(81)11(54)(14)Othereffects--1-(1)Balance at the end358514339348350Download tableMillions of EurosNet Liability (asset)Post-employment commitments2016SpainMexicoUnited StatesTurkeyRestoBalance at the beginning6,109(79)359724Current service cost1064225Interest income or expense98(7)182Contributions by plan participants----0Employer contributions -(14)(1)(17)(9)Past service costs(1)2401-4(4)Remeasurements:1882310811 Return on plan assets(2)(35)233(23)(23) From changes in demographic assumptions-2(5)-(1) From changes in financial assumptions192(22)13(23)37 Other actuarial gain and losses3119(1)54(2)Benefit payments(867)-(3)(9)(2)Settlement payments(43)----Business combinations and disposal-----Effect on changes in foreign exchange rates-102(15)(4)Othereffects63-(3)-20Balance at the end5,799(59)469942(1) Including gains and losses arising from settlements.

However, a significant number of the insurance contracts are with BBVA Seguros, S.A. and CatalunyaCaixa Vida –consolidated subsidiaries and related parties – and consequently these policies cannot be considered plan assets under IAS 19. For this reason, the liabilities insured under these policies are fully recognized under the heading “Provisions – Pensions and other post-employment defined benefit obligations” of the accompanying consolidated balance sheet (see Note 24), while the related assets held by the insurance company are included within the Group´s consolidated assets (registered according to the classification of the corresponding financial instruments). As of December 31, 2016 the value of these separate assets was €2,983 million, representing direct rights of the insured employees held in the consolidated balance sheet, hence these benefits are effectively fully funded,On the other hand, some pension commitments have been funded through insurance contracts with insurance companies not related to the Group, and can therefore be considered qualifying insurance policies and plan assets under IAS 19. In this case the accompanying consolidated balance sheet reflects the value of the obligations net of the fair value of the qualifying insurance policies. As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of the aforementioned insurance policies (€358 million, €380 million and €382 million, respectively) exactly match the value of the corresponding obligations and therefore no amount for this item has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.Pensions benefits are paid by the insurance companies with whom BBVA has insurance contracts and to whom all insurance premiums have been paid. The premiums are determined by the insurance companies using “cash flow matching” techniques to ensure that benefits can be met when due, guaranteeing both the actuarial and interest rate risk.In Mexico, there is a defined benefit plan for employees hired prior to 2001. Other employees participate in a defined contribution plan. External funds/trusts have been constituted locally to meet benefit payments as required by local regulation.In The United States there are mainly two defined benefit plans, both closed to new employees, who instead are able to join a defined contribution plan. External funds/trusts have been constituted locally to fund the plans, as required by local regulation.In 2008, the Turkish government passed a law to unify the different existing pension systems under a single umbrella of Social Security. Such system provides for the transfer of the various prior funds established.The financial sector is in this stage at present, maintaining these pension commitments managed by external pension funds (foundations) established for that purpose.The foundation that maintains the assets and liabilities relating to employees of Garanti in Turkey, as per the local regulatory requirements, has registered an obligation amounting to €218 million as of December 31, 2016 pending future social security transfer.Furthermore, the Group has set up a defined benefit pension plan for employees, additional to the social security benefits, reflected in the consolidated balance sheet.The Bank also has commitments to pay indemnities to certain employees and members of the Group’s Senior Management in the event that they cease to hold their positions for reasons other than their own will, retirement, disability or serious dereliction of duties. The amount will be calculated according to the salary and professional conditions of each employee, taking into consideration fixed elements of the remuneration and the length of office at the Bank. Under no circumstances indemnities will be paid in cases of disciplinary dismissal for misconduct upon decision of the employer on grounds of the employee’s serious dereliction of duties.In 2016 as a consequence of certain Senior Management members leaving the Group, indemnities for an overall total of €1,788 thousand were paid, which have been recorded as Other Personnel Expenses (see Note 44).Medical benefit commitmentsThe change in defined benefit obligations and plan assets during the years 2016, 2015 and 2014 was as follows:Millions of Euros201620152014Medical Benefits CommitmentsDefined Benefit ObligationPlan AssetsNet Liability (asset)Defined Benefit ObligationPlan AssetsNet Liability (asset)Defined Benefit ObligationPlan AssetsNet Liability (asset)Balance at the beginning1,0221,149(127)1,0831,240(157)811938(128)Current service cost24-2431-3123-23Interest income or expense8697(11)95109(14)7890(13)Contributions by plan participants---------Employer contributions -114(114)----183(183)Past service costs(1)(5)-(5)1-11-1Remeasurements:59(60)119(87)(94)719046144 Return on plan assets(2)-(60)60-(94)94-46(46) From changes in demographic assumptions110-110------ From changes in financial assumptions(91)-(91)(91)-(91)181-181 Other actuarial gain and losses39-394-410-10Benefit payments(33)(30)(2)(30)(30)-(29)(28)(1)Settlement payments---(2)-(2)---Business combinations and disposal---------Effect on changes in foreign exchange rates(138)(156)18(69)(76)8910(1)Othereffects-------1(1)Balance at the end1,0151,113(98)1,0221,149(127)1,0831,240(157)Download table(1) Including gains and losses arising from settlements.

New employees from 2007 are covered by medical insurance policy. An external trust has been constituted locally to fund the plan, in accordance with local legislation and Group policy.In Turkey employees are currently provided with medical benefits through a foundation in collaboration with the social security system, although local legislation prescribes the future unification of this and similar systems into the general social security system itself.The valuation of these benefits and their accounting treatment follow the same methodology as that employed in the valuation of pension commitments.Estimated benefit paymentsThe estimated benefit payments over the next ten years for all the entities in Spain, Mexico,The United States and Turkey are as follows:Millions of EurosEstimated Benefit Payments201720182019202020212022-2026Commitments in Spain8207366525634701,269Commitments in Mexico7980848893556Commitments in United States1718181920112Commitments in Turkey2515161821165Total9418497706886042,102Plan assetsThe majority of the Group´s defined benefit plans are funded by plan assets held in external funds/trusts legally separate from the Group sponsoring entity. However, in accordance with local regulation, some commitments are not externally funded and covered through internally held provisions, principally those relating to early retirements in Spain.Plan assets are those assets which will be used to directly settle the assumed commitments and which meet the following conditions: they are not part of the Group sponsoring entity´s assets, they are available only to pay post-employment benefits and they cannot be returned to the Group sponsoring entity.To manage the assets associated with defined benefit plans, BBVA Group has established investment policies designed according to criteria of prudence and minimizing the financial risks associated with plan assets.The investment policy consists of investing in a low risk and diversified portfolio of assets with maturities consistent with the term of the benefit obligation and which, together with contributions made to the plan, will be sufficient to meet benefit payments when due, thus mitigating the plans‘ risks.In those countries where plan assets are held in pension funds or trusts, the investment policy is developed consistently with local regulation. When selecting specific assets, current market conditions, the risk profile of the assets and their future market outlook are all taken into consideration. In all the cases, the selection of assets takes into consideration the term of the benefit obligations as well as short-term liquidity requirements.The risks associated with these commitments are those which give rise to a deficit in the plan assets. A deficit could arise from factors such as a fall in the market value of plan assets, an increase in long-term interest rates leading to a decrease in the fair value of fixed income securities, or a deterioration of the economy resulting in more write-downs and credit rating downgrades.The table below shows the allocation of plan assets of the main companies of the BBVA Group as of December 31, 2016:Millions of EurosPlan Assets Breakdown2016Cash or cash equivalents151Debt securities (Government bonds)2,150Property1Mutual funds1Insurance contracts5Other investments9Total2,317 Of which:2,317 Bank account in BBVA4 Debt securities issued by BBVA3In addition to the above there are plan assets relating to the previously mentioned insurance contracts in Spain and the foundation in Turkey.The following table provides details of investments in listed securities (Level 1) as of December 31, 2016:Millions of EurosInvestments in listed markets2016Cash or cash equivalents151Debt securities (Government bonds)2,150Mutual funds1Total2,302Of which:&amp;nbsp; Bank account in BBVA4 Debt securities issued by BBVA3The remainders of the assets are mainly invested in Level 2 assets in in accordance with the classification established under IFRS 13 (mainly insurance contracts).

Some of these plans allow employees to make contributions which are then matched by the employer.Contributions are recognized as and when they are accrued, with a charge to the consolidated income statement in the corresponding financial year. No liability is therefore recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet (see Note 44.1).26.

Capital base and capital managementCapital baseAs of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, equity is calculated in accordance with current regulation on minimum capital base requirements for Spanish credit institutions –both as individual entities and as consolidated group– and how to calculate them, as well as the various internal capital adequacy assessment processes they should have in place and the information they should disclose to the market.The minimum capital base requirements established by the current regulation are calculated according to the Group’s exposure to credit and dilution risk, counterparty and liquidity risk relating to the trading portfolio, exchange-rate risk and operational risk. In addition, the Group must fulfill the risk concentration limits established in said regulation and the internal corporate governance obligations.As a result of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) carried out by the European Central Bank (ECB), BBVA has received a communication from the ECB requiring BBVA to maintain, on a consolidated basis, effective from the 1st of January 2017, a phased-in total capital of 11,125% and on an individual bases, a phased-in total capital of 10.75%.This total capital requirement of 11,125% includes: i) the minimum CET1 capital ratio required under Pillar 1 (4.5%); ii) Pillar 1 Additional Tier 1 capital requirements (1.5%); iii) Pillar 1 Tier 2 capital requirements (2%); iv) Pillar 2 CET1 capital requirement (1.5%); v) the capital conservation buffer (CCB) (1.25% CET1 in a phased-in term and 2.5% in a fully loaded term) and vi) the Other Systemic Important Institution buffer (OSII) (0,375% CET1 in a phased-in term and 0.75% in a fully loaded term).Since BBVA has been excluded from the list of global systemically important financial institutions in 2016 (which is updated every year by the Financial Stability Board (FSB)), as of January 1, 2017, the G-SIB buffer will not apply to BBVA in 2017, (notwithstanding the possibility that the FSB or the supervisor may include BBVA on it in the future).However, the supervisor has informed BBVA that it is included on the list of other systemically important financial institutions, and a D-SIB buffer of 0.75% of the fully-loaded ratio applies at the consolidated level. It will be implemented gradually from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2019. The CET1 requirement on phased-in terms stands at 7,625% on a consolidated basis and 7.25% on an individual basis.The Group’s bank capital in accordance with the aforementioned applicable regulation, considering entities scope required by the above regulation, as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is shown below: (please note that the information for the latter period has been adapted to the new presentation format for comparison purposes):Millions of EurosEligible capital resourcesReconciliation of totalequity with regulatorycapital December2016 (*) equity with regulatorycapital December2016 (*) Reconciliation of totalequity with regulatorycapital December2015 (**)Reconciliation of totalequity with regulatorycapital December2014Capital3,2183,1203,024Share premium23,99223,99223,992Retained earnings, revaluation reserves and other reserves23,64122,51220,936OOther equity instruments (net)543567Treasury shares(48)(309)(350)Attributable to the parent company3,4752,6422,618Attributable dividend(1,510)(1,352)(841)Total Equity 52,82150,64049,446Accumulated other comprehensive income(5,458)(3,349)(348)Non-controlling interests8,0648,1492,511Shareholders´ equity55,42855,44051,610Intangible assets (5,675)(3,901)(1,748)Fin. treasury shares(82)(95)(124)Indirect treasury shares(51)(415)-Deductions(5,808)(4,411)(1,872)Temporary CET 1 adjustments(129)(788)(3,567) Capital gains from the Available-for-sale debt instruments portfolio(402)(796)(2,713) Capital gains from the Available-for-sale equity portfolio2738(854)Differences from solvency and accounting level(120)(40)(140)Other adjustments and deductions(249)(828)(3,707)Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1)(2,001)(1,647)(1,414)Additional Tier 1 before Regulatory Adjustments47,37048,55444,617Total Regulatory Adjustments of Aditional Tier 16,1145,3024,205Tier 1(3,401)(5,302)(6,990)Tier 250,08348,55441,831Other deductions8,81011,64610,986Total Capital (Total Capital=Tier 1 + Tier 2)58,89360,20052,817Total Minimum equity required (**)37,92038,12528,064Download table(*) Provisional data.(**) Figures originally reported in the Prudential Relevance Report corresponding to the year 2015, without restatements.Millions of EurosCapital Base2016 (*)20152014Tier 1 (thousand of euros) (a)50,08348,55441,832Exposure (thousand of euros) (b)747,217766,589671,081Leverage ratio (a)/(b) (percentage)6.70%6.33%6.23%Download table(*) Provisional dataVariations in the amount of Tier 1 Common Equity in the above table are mainly explained by the organic generation of capital leaning against the recurrence of the results, net of dividends paid and remunerations; and the efficient management and allocation of capital in line with the strategic objectives of the Group.Additionally, there is a negative effect on the minority interests and deductions due to the regulatory phase-in calendar of 60% in 2016 compared with 40% in 2015.During the first semester of the year, BBVA Group has completed the additional Tier 1 capital recommended by the Regulator (1.5% of Risk-Weighted Assets) with the issuance of perpetual securities eventually convertible into shares, classified as additional Tier 1 equity instruments (contingent convertible) under the solvency rules and contributing to the ratio of Tier 1 stood at 12.88%Finally, the total capital ratio is located at 15.14% reflecting the effects discussed above.The increase in minimum capital requirements is mainly due to the consideration of the aforementioned new prudential capital requirements applicable to BBVA.A reconciliation of the balance sheet to the accounting and regulatory scope (provisional data) as of December 31, 2016 is provided below:Millions of EurosPublic balance sheet headingsPublic balance sheetInsurance companies and real estate companiesJointlycontrolled entities and other adjustmentsRegulatory balance sheetCash and balances with central banks and other demand deposits 40,039-5940,098Financial assets held for trading 74,950(1,117)2,50976,342Other financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss 2,062(2,058)-4Available-for-sale financial assets79,221(20,608)2558,638Loans and receivables465,977(1,298)2,010466,689Held-to-maturity investments17,696--17,696Fair value changes of the hedged items in portfolio hedges of interest rate risk 2,833(124)-2,709Hedging derivatives17--17Non-current assets held for sale7653,716(103)4,378Investments in entities accounted for using the equity method3,603(14)(29)3,560Other44,693(2,862)2,62244,453Total Assets731,856(24,365)7,093714,584Capital managementCapital management in the BBVA Group has a twofold aim:Maintain a level of capitalization according to the business objectives in all countries in which it operates and, simultaneously,Maximize the return on shareholders’ funds through the efficient allocation of capital to the different units, a good management of the balance sheet and appropriate use of the various instruments forming the basis of the Group’s equity: shares, preferred securities and subordinate debt.This capital management is carried out determining the capital base and the solvency ratios established by the prudential and minimum capital requirements also have to be met for the entities subject to prudential supervision in each country.The current regulation allows each entity to apply its own internal ratings-based (IRB) approach to risk assessment and capital management, subject to Bank of Spain approval. The BBVA Group carries out an integrated management of these risks in accordance with its internal policies and its internal capital estimation model has received the Bank of Spain’s approval for certain portfolios (see Note 7).33.

These amounts have been recognized with a corresponding entry under the heading “Shareholders’ funds - Other equity instruments” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, net of tax effect.The characteristics of the Group’s remuneration plans based on equity instruments are described below.System of Variable Remuneration in SharesIn BBVA, the annual variable remuneration applying to all employees consists of a one incentive only, paid in cash, awarded once a year and linked to the achievement of previously established goals and to a sound risk management based on the design of incentives that are aligned with the company’s long-term interests and that take into account current and future risks (hereinafter, the “Annual Variable Remuneration”).Nevertheless, the remuneration policy of the BBVA Group, in force since 2015, has a specific settlement and payment scheme of the Annual Variable Remuneration applicable to those employees, including the executive directors and members of the BBVA Senior Management, performing professional activities that may have a significant impact on the risk profile of the Group or engaged in control functions (hereinafter, the “Identified Staff”), that includes, among others, the payment in shares of part of their Annual Variable Remuneration.This remuneration policy was approved for the directors by the Annual General Meeting, March 13, 2015.The specific settlement and payment scheme for the Annual Variable Remuneration of executive directors and members of the Senior Management is described in Note 54, while the rules listed below are applicable to the rest of the Identified Staff:The Annual Variable Remuneration of members of the Identified Staff will be paid in equal parts in cash and BBVA shares.The payment of 40% of the Annual Variable Remuneration, - 50% in the case of the executive directors and the members of the Senior Management - both in cash and in shares, will be deferred in its entirety for three years. Its accrual and payment will be subject to compliance with a series of multi-year indicators related to share performance and the Group’s basic control and risk management metrics measuring solvency, liquidity and profitability, which will be calculated throughout the deferral period (hereinafter “Multi-year Performance Indicators”). These Multi-year Performance Indicators may lead to a reduction in the amount deferred, and might even bring it down to zero, but they will not be used under any circumstances to increase the aforementioned deferred remuneration.All the shares delivered to these beneficiaries would be unavailable for a period of time after they have vested, according to the rules explained in the previous paragraph. This withholding will be applied against the net amount of the shares, after deducting any tax accruing on the shares received.A prohibition is also established against hedging with unavailable vested shares and shares pending reception.Moreover, circumstances have been established in which the payment of the deferred Annual Variable Remuneration may be limited or impeded (“malus” clauses), as well as the adjustment to update these deferred parts.Finally, the variable component of the remuneration corresponding to any one financial year of those in the Identified Staff will be limited to an upper threshold of 100% of the fixed component of the total remuneration, unless the General Meeting should resolve to raise this limit which, in any event, may not exceed 200% of the fixed component of the total remuneration.In this regard, the Annual General Meeting held on March 14, 2014 resolved, in line with applicable legislation, the application of the maximum level of variable remuneration up to 200% of the fixed remuneration for a specific group of employees whose professional activities have a material impact on the Group’s risk profile or are engaged in control functions. Additionally, the General Meeting held on March 13, 2015, resolved to enlarge this group, whose variable remuneration will be subject to the maximum threshold of 200% of the fixed component of their total remuneration. This is entirely consistent with the Recommendations Report issued by the BBVA’s Board of Directors on February 3, 2015.According to the settlement and payment scheme mentioned above, in 2016 a number of 5,187,750 shares corresponding to the initial payment of 2015 Annual Variable Remuneration were delivered to the beneficiary members of the Identified Staff.Additionally, the remuneration policy prevailing until 2014 provided a specific settlement and payment scheme for the variable remuneration of the Identified Staff that established a deferral period of three years for the Annual Variable Remuneration, being the deferred amount paid in thirds over this period.According to this prior scheme, in 2016 the shares corresponding to the deferred parts of the Annual Variable Remuneration paid in shares from previous years, and their corresponding adjustments in cash, were delivered to the beneficiary members of the Identified Staff, giving rise in 2016, of a total of 945.053 shares corresponding to the first deferred third of the 2014 Annual Variable Remuneration were granted, and €349.670 as adjustments for updates of the shares granted; a total of 438.082 shares corresponding to the second deferred third of the 2013 Annual Variable Remuneration, and €340,828 in adjustments for updates; and a total of 502,622 shares corresponding to the final third of the 2012 Annual Variable Remuneration, with €551,879 in adjustments for updates.Likewise, in 2016 the Identified Staff received the shares corresponding to the deferred parts of the long-term incentive programmes in the United States, as outlined below:When the term of the Long-Term Incentive 2010-2012 Plan for the BBVA Compass Management Team ended, on December 31, 2012, it was settled pursuant to the conditions established when it began.For those beneficiaries of this programme who are members of the Identified Staff, it was agreed that the same settlement and payment rules would be applied mentioned above, in line with the remuneration policy in force prior to 2015 which established a payment of the deferred amount in thirds over the deferral period.Thus, in 2016 those beneficiaries who are members of the Identified Staff in BBVA Compass have been awarded 6,314 shares, corresponding to the last third of the deferred part of the shares resulting from the settlement of the 2010-2012 Long-Term Incentive Share Plan, and €6,933 in the adjustment to the updated share value.Additionally, BBVA Compass’ remuneration structure includes long-term incentive programmes for remuneration in shares for employees in certain key positions. These plans run over a three-year term. On December 31, 2016 there is one programme in force (2014-2016). In 2016, 206.190 shares corresponding to this programme were delivered.44.2 General and administrative expensesThe breakdown of the balance under this heading in the accompanying consolidated income statements is as follows:Millions of EurosGeneral and Administrative Expenses201620152014Technology and systems673625585Communications294281271Advertising398387333Property, fixtures and materials1,0801,030916Of which: Rent expenses (*)616591461Taxes other than income tax433466418Other expenses1,7661,7751,480Total4,6444,5634,004Download table(*) The consolidated companies do not expect to terminate the lease contracts early.45 DepreciationThe breakdown of the balance under this heading in the accompanying consolidated income statements is as follows:Millions of EurosDepreciationNotes201620152014Tangible assets17690641611For own use&amp;nbsp;667615589 Investment properties&amp;nbsp;232522Assets leased out under financial lease&amp;nbsp;---Other Intangible assets18.2735631535Total&amp;nbsp;1,4261,2721,14546.

This comprises a fixed remuneration and a variable remuneration, which is in turn made up of a single incentive (hereinafter the “Annual Variable Remuneration”).Thus, during 2016, the executive directors were paid the amount of fixed remuneration corresponding to that year and the Annual Variable Remuneration corresponding to 2015, paid during the first quarter of the year 2016, according to the settlement and payment system set out in the current Remuneration Policy for BBVA Directors as approved by the General Meeting held on 13 March 2015 (hereinafter, the “Settlement and Payment System”). The Settlement and Payment System provides that:The Annual Variable Remuneration will be paid in equal parts in cash and in BBVA shares.50% of the Annual Variable Remuneration, in cash and in shares, will be deferred in its entirety for a three-year period, and its accrual and vesting shall be subject to compliance with a series of multi-year indicators.All the shares vested under the rules explained in the previous paragraphs would be unavailable for the period of time determined by the Board of Directors, as from the respective vesting. This withholding will be applied with respect to the net amount of the shares, after discounting the necessary part to pay the tax accruing on the shares received.No hedging strategies may be carried out on the shares received and unavailable or on the shares pending to be received.Moreover, circumstances have been established in which disbursement of the Annual Variable Remuneration may be limited or impeded (“malus” clauses).The deferred parts of the Annual Variable Remuneration would be adjusted to update them under the terms established by the Board of Directors.Likewise, in application of the settlement and payment system of the Annual Variable Remuneration corresponding to years 2014, 2013 and 2012, under the applicable policy for those years, the executive directors have received the deferred parts of the Annual Variable Remuneration corresponding to those years, which vested in the first quarter of year 2016.Pursuant to the above, the remuneration paid to the executive directors during 2016 is shown below.

The executive directors will receive, during the first quarter of each of the next two years, the deferred amounts that in each case correspond in application of the settlement of the deferred Annual Variable Remuneration from previous years (2014 and 2013), and subject to the conditions established in the applicable settlement and payment system. Likewise, during 2016, the executive directors received payment in kind, including insurance premiums and others, amounting to an overall total of €240 thousand, of which €17 thousand were paid to the Group Executive Chairman; €139 thousand to the Chief Executive Officer; and €84 thousand to the executive director Head of GERPA.Annual Variable Remuneration for executive directors for the year 2016Following year-end 2016, the Annual Variable Remuneration for the executive directors corresponding to that year has been determined applying the conditions established for that purpose at the beginning of that year, as set forth in the Remuneration Policy for BBVA Directors as approved by the General Meeting held on 13 March 2015. Consequently, during the first quarter of 2017, the executive directors will receive 50% of the 2016 Annual Variable Remuneration, in equal parts in cash and in shares, i.e., €734 thousand and 114.204 BBVA shares in the case of the Group Executive Chairman; €591 thousand and 91,915 BBVA shares the case of the Chief Executive Officer; and €89 thousand and 13,768 BBVA shares the case of the executive director Head of GERPA.The remaining 50%, in cash and in shares, will be deferred for a three-year period, and its accrual and vesting will be subject to compliance with multi-year indicators established by the Board of Directors at the beginning of the year. Based on the result of each multi-year indicator during the deferred period and applying the performance scales assigned to each of them and their weightings, the final deferred amount of the Annual Variable Remuneration will be determined after the deferred period. The deferred Annual Variable Remuneration may be reduced and even reach zero, but in no event may be increased. To these effect, the maximum amounts that could be received during the first quarter of 2020 are: €734 thousand and 114.204 BBVA shares the case of the Group Executive Chairman; €591 thousand and 91,915 BBVA shares the case of the Chief Executive Officer; and €89 thousand and 13,768 BBVA shares the case of the executive director Head of GERPA; all subject to the settlement and payment conditions established in the Remuneration Policy for BBVA Directors.These amounts are recorded under the item “Other Liabilities” of the balance sheet at 31 December 2016.Remuneration of the members of the Senior Management received in 2016During 2016, the remuneration paid to the members of BBVA’s Senior Management as a whole, excluding executive directors, is shown below (itemised):Thousands of EurosRemuneration of members of the Senior ManagementFixed Remuneration2015 Annual Variable Remuneration in cash (1)Deferred variable remuneration in cash (2) Total Cash2015 Annual Variable Remuneration in BBVA shares (1) Deferred Variable Remuneration in BBVA shares (2)Total SharesTotal Members of the Senior Management (*)11,1152,4571,34314,915370,505155,746526,251(*) This section includes aggregate information regarding the members of BBVA Group’s Senior Management, excluding executive directors, who were members of the Senior Management as of 31 December 2016 (14 members).(1) Amounts corresponding to 50% of 2015 Annual Variable Remuneration.

In the case of the executive director Head of GERPA, the provisions recorded as of 31 December 2016 amounted to €609 thousand, of which €310 have been provisioned against earnings of the year. In both cases, these amounts include the provisions covering retirement, as well as death and disability.There are no other pension obligations in favour of other executive directors.The provisions recorded as of 31 December 2016 for pension commitments for members of the Senior Management, excluding executive directors, amounted to €46,299 thousand, of which, during 2016 and according to applicable accounting regulations, €4,895 thousand have been provisioned against earnings of the year and €2,226 thousand against equity, in order to adapt the interest rate assumption used for the valuation of pension commitments in Spain. These amounts include the provisions covering retirement, as well as death and disability.As a result of the entry into force of Circular 2/2016, of the Bank of Spain to the credit institutions, 15% of the annual contributions agreed to pension systems determined on the basis of the vesting estimated for the financial year corresponding to executive directors and BBVA’s senior managers, will be based on variable components and will be considered as discretionary pension benefits, and in consequence will be deemed as deferred variable remuneration, subject to the payment and retention conditions provided in the applicable regulations, as well as malus arrangements and other applicable conditions established to the variable remuneration in the Remuneration Policy for BBVA’s Directors.Extinction of contractual relationshipThe Bank has no commitments to pay severance indemnity to executive directors other than to the executive director Head of GERPA, whose contract includes, as of 31 December 2016, his right to receive an indemnity equivalent to two times his fixed remuneration should he cease to hold his position on grounds other than his own will, death, retirement, disability or dereliction of duty.The contractual conditions of the Chief Executive Officer with regard to his pension arrangements determine that, as of 31 December 2016, in the event of his ceasing to hold his position on grounds other than his own will, retirement, disability or dereliction of duty, he will take early retirement with a pension that he may receive as a lifelong annuity or as a capital lump sum, at his own choice. The annual amount will be calculated as a function of the provisions which, according to the actuarial criteria applicable at any time, the Bank may have made up to that date to cover the retirement pension commitments provided for in his contract, without this commitment in any way compelling the Bank to set aside additional provisions. Moreover, this pension may not be greater than 75% of the pensionable base should the event occur before he reaches the age of 55, or 85% of the pensionable base should the event occur after having reached the age of 55.According to the proposal for a new Remuneration Policy for BBVA’s Directors to be submitted to the next Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting in 2017, if approved, the pension scheme and the extinction of contractual relationships of the executive directors, the Chief Executive Officer and the Head of GERPA will be amended for 2017 and following financial years, in the terms established under such Policy.55. Other information55.1 Environmental impactGiven the activities BBVA Group entities engage in, the Group has no environmental liabilities, expenses, assets, provisions or contingencies that could have a significant effect on its consolidated equity, financial situation and profits. Consequently, as of December 31, 2016, there is no item in the Group’s accompanying consolidated financial statements that requires disclosure in an environmental information report pursuant to Ministry of Economy Order JUS/206/2009 dated January 28, and consequently no specific disclosure of information on environmental matters is included in these financial statements.55.2 Reporting requirements of the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV)Dividends paid in the yearThe table below presents the dividends per share paid in cash in 2016, 2015 and 2014 (cash basis dividend, regardless of the year in which they were accrued, but without including other shareholder remuneration, such as the “Dividend Option”).

      "content"  : "Other legal disclosure requirementsAlternative Performance Measures (APMs)BBVA presents its results in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (EU-IFRS). However, it also considers that some alternative performance measures (APMs) provide useful additional financial information that should be taken into account when evaluating performance. These APMs are also used when making financial, operational and planning decisions within the Entity. The Group firmly believes that they give a true and fair view of its financial information. These APMs are generally used in the financial sector as indicators for monitoring the assets, liabilities and economic and financial situation of entities.BBVA Group’s APMs are given below. They are presented in accordance with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) guidelines, published on October 5, 2015 ESMA/2015/1415en). These guidelines are aimed at promoting the usefulness and transparency of APMs included in prospectuses or regulated information to protect investors in the European Union. In accordance with the indications given in the guidelines, BBVA Group’s APMs:Include clear and readable definitions of the APMs (paragraphs 21-25).Disclose the reconciliations to the most directly reconcilable line item, subtotal or total presented in the financial statements of the corresponding period, separately identifying and explaining the material reconciling items (paragraphs 26-32).Are standard measures generally used in the financial industry, so their use provides comparability in the analysis of performance between issuers (paragraphs 33-34).Do not have greater preponderance than measures directly stemming from financial statements (paragraphs 35-36).Are accompanied by comparatives for previous periods (paragraphs 37-40).Are consistent over time (paragraphs 41-44).Book value per shareThe book value per share determines the value of the company on its books for each share held by the shareholder.Explanation of the formula: The figures for both the shareholders’ funds and accumulated other comprehensive income are taken from the balance sheet. Shareholders’ funds are adjusted to take into account the execution of the“dividend-option” at the closing dates on which it was agreed to deliver this type of dividend before publication. The denominator includes the final number of outstanding shares excluding own shares (treasury shares).

The key in this scenario of weak economic growth within a context of reduced global trade and a greater aversion to the spread of globalization lies in addressing the economic consequences of some of the risks linked to economic policies. First, there is the uncertainty in connection with the economic policy of the new administration in the United States, particularly regarding protectionism and its potential global effects. Second, while the impact of Brexit (the referendum at the end of June resulting in a victory for those wanting the United Kingdom to leave the European Union) has not had a systemic impact, there is nevertheless lingering uncertainty regarding the negotiations related to it, which could weigh heavily on economic confidence in 2017. An additional factor is concern with respect to the results of a very busy electoral calendar throughout Europe.The 2017 outlook for Spain is one of moderate growth of up to 2.7%, in light of the weakening of some support factors such as fiscal policy and an increase in oil prices.The recovery in the rest of Europe faces the risk of a slowdown associated with political uncertainty or the reversal of the reforms implemented in some countries. In this context, we expect a GDP growth of 1.7% in 2016 and 1.6% in 2017.In the United States, there are still major doubts regarding economic policy, particularly with respect to trade agreements, as well as the rate of interest rate hikes by the FED and their resulting impact on emerging economies. In light of the foregoing, the average growth in 2016 will slow to 1.6% and then increase slightly above 2% in 2017. In this scenario, the FED is expected to conduct a gradual normalization process in a context characterized by the uncertainty of the external environment together with the FED’s own concerns regarding the trending growth in productivity and the economy’s potential GDP growth.The key for emerging economies is management of their vulnerability to sudden movements of capital. There has been increased inflationary pressure in Turkey, which could lead to a tougher monetary policy in an environment of growth of approximately 2.5% in 2016 and 2017. The pace of economic growth in Mexico could have tapered off slightly to below 2% in 2016 and this slowdown may become more pronounced, down to 1% in 2017, given the uncertainty associated with the trade measures adopted by the United States. The GDP of South America as a whole could contract by over 2% in 2016, though it should recover and post growth of slightly over 1% in 2017 thanks to the increased contribution from the foreign sector, the end of the downturn in Brazil, private investment in Argentina and the plans for public-sector investment in countries such as Peru and Colombia.However, in the more medium and longer term, the greatest risk for the global economy remains linked to the imbalances in China’s economy. In this regard, concerns regarding a substantial slowdown in 2016 were allayed after reports of 6.6% growth (6.9% in 2015). However, the outlook continues to be for a gradual slowdown to around 6% in 2017. In the long term, doubts regarding the prospects of growth remain, given the slow progress of structural reforms in some key areas, particularly in state-owned companies.Staff informationOne of BBVA’s six Strategic Priorities to make progress in its digital transformation is “a first class workforce”. This entails attracting, developing, motivating and retaining a first class workforce, and providing the best employee experience. To do so, the Organization is being transformed, fostering a new culture, with new ways of working (an organization based on projects, communities of expertise, agile methodology, collaborative tools, etc.) and flatter structures. A new variable remuneration model was also implemented in line with the strategic objectives.BBVA Group.

Three basic principles have also been defined to guide this activity:Proximity to the business: acting as business partners for the other areas.Focus on execution: delivering new data-based solutions with committed deadlines, and making things simple.One team: working as a single team across all regions, with no functional silos.Talent &amp;amp; Culture has conducted a strategic prioritization process for selecting the global programs in which to make progress. Thus, among the new projects launched were those related to professional careers, internal mobility, values, performance and the leadership modelProfessional developmentA relevant aspect for professional development at BBVA is the biennial process for determining each professional’s strengths and areas for improvement. The last process was carried out in 2015, when each professional received feedback from his/her manager and training and development plans were established and subsequently executed in 2016. In addition to the performance indicators, the results of the process proved to be key in identifying critical talent in the Group and supporting promotion decisions.BBVA Group makes a variety of resources available to employees so they can grow professionally and improve their skills:Recruitment processes are based on equal opportunity, evaluation based on the requirements of the job position and objectivity of the criteria used. The ultimate goal is to attract and incorporate the best talent in each field. In 2016, BBVA Group received 352,477 resumes worldwide with a ratio of men to women of 57%-43%, 75.42% of them under the age of 30; and it hired 15,243 people, 62% of them under the age of 30.Apúntate+: a global internal job posting application that fosters career development and transparency in promotion criteria by posting available job vacancies.Training actions increased in 2016 to an average of 39 hours of training per employee, with 66% of the training done through the online channel. The Group’s investment in training amounted to €45,5m.With regard to the legal requirements established by the MiFID II Directive, on the knowledge that employees must have when distributing information or providing advice on financial products/services within Europe, there are 7.610 professionals with official EFPA certifications (DAF/EIP, EFA and EFP) in Spain. In all, there are over 10.500 current employee certifications in BBVA, including CFA, FRM and CIA.Diversity: women make up 54% of the Group’s staff and their numbers in the management team has continued to increase since 2011 to 20.8% in 2016.Different capabilities: BBVA continues demonstrating its pledge to integrate people with different capabilities into the workforce through the Plan Integra, which was conceived with the belief that employment is an essential pillar in achieving equal opportunity for everyone.WorkplaceBBVA conducts a general satisfaction and commitment survey involving all employees every two years. The purpose of this survey is to ascertain the views of our employees, their concerns and the areas for improvement on which they consider we should work in the future. The 2016 survey was answered by over 70% of BBVA employees worldwide, with 83% of them being satisfied or very satisfied.Within the scope of responsible investment, BBVA assumed its Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) commitment in 2008 when it joined the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment through the Employee Pension Plan.With respect to occupational health and safety, BBVA honors its commitment to guarantee healthy working environments and improve the quality of life of people through health promotion and prevention campaigns and training, information and awareness-raising activities. The occupational health and safety plan in Spain is part of the preventive planning that sets yearly targets based on the occupational risk prevention activities scheduled for the period. It includes risk assessments and monitoring of corrective measures, evacuation drills and emergency plans, training for workers, coordination of business activity, healthcare monitoring through medical checkups, health promotion campaigns, protection for vulnerable workers, adapting workstations with specific ergonomic material to prevent related pathologies (back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, etc.).Occupational health in SpainNumber201620152014Number of technical preventive actions2,4243,0332,157Number of preventive actions to improve working conditions2,9813,7612,869Appointments for health checks15,10017,65916,145Employees represented in health and safety committees (%)100100100Absenteeism rate (%) (1)2.42.52.2Download table(1) Catalunya Banc is excluded from the calculation in 2015.The rights and working conditions of Group employees are included in the rules, conventions and agreements concluded in each entity with the corresponding workers’ representatives in accordance with local legislation. On matters of freedom of association and labor union representation, BBVA always aims for solutions via consensus. It places a very high value on dialog and negotiation as the best way of resolving any conflict in accordance with the pertinent local regulations in force in the countries where BBVA operates.The Thirteenth Collective Labor Agreement for the Spanish banking sector, covering our entire workforce, was signed in April 2016 and will remain in force until December 31, 2018. Additional business agreements supplement and develop the provisions of the Labor Agreement, such as the agreement to adapt the provisions of the Collective Labor Agreement with respect to remuneration.Labor union representatives sitting on company committees are elected every four years by personal, free, direct and secret vote. The labor representatives are kept apprised of any changes in relevant organization that could occur in the Company, as provided for by the pertinent legislation currently in force.BBVA Spain has also concluded a Merger Labor Agreement to integrate the employees of Catalunya Banc (CX) into BBVA. This was done in July, harmonizing the employment conditions of all CX employees to those current in BBVA.RemunerationBBVA has an advanced remuneration system based on the reciprocal long-term generation of value for professionals in line with shareholder interests and dependent on prudent management. This system is adapted to legal specifications in force at any time and also incorporates the standards and principles of the best generally accepted national and international practices.Remuneration is made up of two clearly differentiated parts:A fixed remuneration, which is established by considering the employee’s level of responsibility and professional career path in the Group and setting a salary benchmark for each function.Variable remuneration, with a new model that is linked to the Group’s strategic objectives through indicators formed by both financial and non-financial indicators. In this new model, each employee’s variable remuneration is directly linked to the results at Group, area and sub-area/individual level.Volunteer workThe BBVA Corporate Volunteering Policy covers all countries. It manifests BBVA’s pledge to volunteer work of this type and provides employees with the conditions in which they can engage in corporate volunteer work that generates a positive social impact. Most volunteering activities seek to reinforce initiatives in connection with education, primarily to boost financial literacy, and thus support the strategic lines set out in the responsible business model. Some of the Group’s educational volunteer projects include:In Spain: the JAES Foundation programs, such as Ventajas de permanecer en el colegio (Advantages of staying in school), Habilidades para el éxito (Skills for success) and Socios por un Día (Partners for a day).In the United States of America: the Summer/Fall Day of Service initiatives and the NBA Cares community engagement program.In Mexico: the Valores de Futuro (Future Values) financial literacy program and the Momentum Project entrepreneurship support program.In South America: financial literacy workshops in Argentina, the Adelante con tu Futuro (Forward with your Future) financial literacy program in Venezuela, the Leer es Estar Adelante (Reading is getting ahead) program in Peru, and the Becas de Integración Jóvenes con Futuro Adelante (Integration Grants for Young People with a Future) and a financial literacy program in Uruguay.Environmental informationEnvironmental commitmentSustainable development is a priority for BBVA Group, given that as a financial institution it has a considerable impact on the environment, whether through the consumption of natural resources, management of its buildings, use of paper, travel, etc. (direct impact), or through the environmental consequences of BBVA Group products and services, particularly those related to financing, asset management and supply chain activities (indirect impact).This commitment is set out in the Group’s Environmental Policy, whose scope is global and affects all the activities carried out by the Group, i.e. banks and activities of subsidiaries in which BBVA has effective control.Objectives of the environmental policyThe objectives of BBVA Group’s environmental policy are:Comply with the environmental legislation in force where BBVA Group operates.Continuously improve the identification and management of environmental risks in BBVA Group’s financial and investment transactions.Integrate the environmental variables into the development of financial products and services.Aim for eco-efficiency in the use of natural resources, establish and fulfill improvement objectives in the Global Eco-efficiency Plan.Manage direct impact through the environmental management system based on ISO 14001 and other recognized environmental certifications.Positively influence the environmental conduct of stakeholders through communication and raising awareness of and sensitivity to the importance of the environment as an additional variable of business and personnel management.Inform, raise awareness, sensitize and train employees concerning the environment.Support sponsorship, volunteer work and environmental research.Main environmental actions in 2016The main environmental actions that BBVA Group carried out during 2016 are described below:Launch of the third Global Eco-efficiency Plan 2016-2020, which establishes objectives in terms of environmental management and sustainable construction, energy and climate change, water, paper and waste. The previous Global Eco-efficiency Plan successfully concluded in 2015, far exceeding the targets set: reduce electricity consumption by 14%, water consumption by 23%, paper consumption by 43% and CO2 emissions by 16%; and increase the number of employees working in buildings that have been awarded environmental certification by 33% (compared with 2012 data).Improvement of the environmental risk management systems not only in project finance, through the Equator Principles, but also in determining borrowers’ credit profiles through the Ecorating tool.Leadership in financing renewable energy project at international level.Active participation in the green bond market.Training in social and environmental risks for Group risk analysts.Activity with multilateral institutions that contribute to regional development through project co-financing and intermediation operations, primarily in agricultural and energy efficiency sectors.Support for the main international initiatives to fight against climate change, such as the CDP, Green Bond Principles, Spanish Green Growth Group, Global Investor Statement on Climate Change, statement of the European Financial Services Round Table in support of a strong, ambitious response to climate change, Statement by Financial Institutions on Energy Efficiency Finance promoted by UNEP FI, and the Energy Efficient Mortgage initiative of the European Mortgage Federation.Development of ambitious programs for environmental patronage, particularly through BBVA Foundation. The Premios Fundación BBVA Fronteras del Conocimiento (BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Awards) in the categories of Conservation Ecology and Biology and Climate Change, each one endowed with a prize of €400,000, and the Premios Fundación BBVA a la Conservación de la Biodiversidad (BBVA Foundation Biodiversity Conservation Awards), endowed with a prize of €580,000.Environmental awareness-raising activities with Group’s employees.As of December 31, 2016, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of BBVA Group have no material item that would warrant inclusion in the environmental information document under the Ministry of the Economy Order dated October 8, 2001.Innovation and technologyAs commented in the Strategy section, BBVA is engaged in a process of digital transformation, the main aim of which is to achieve its aspiration of strengthening relationships with its customers and being the best Bank for them. The Engineering division’s mission is therefore to enable a technology strategy that provides the foundation for this transformation, thus becoming more customer-centric and establishing a more global strategy, fast to develop, digital, flexible, and leveraged on data. This must be done while continuing to provide support to the Bank’s core business: a) catering to the demand for traditional business(multi-segment, multi-product, multi-channel, etc.); and b) contributing reliability, with the necessary tools to ensure adequate internal controls, based on consistent information and data. Likewise, another Engineering objective is to provide the Group with all the tools it needs to drive profitability, new productivity paradigms and new business processes.Customers are at the heart of digital transformation. To deliver on their requirements it is necessary to offer real-time operation, making all the necessary information and procedures available anywhere, anytime, and any channel. The area’s responsibilities therefore need to be revised, particularly regarding rapid product development, the open ecosystem concept and the critical role that data are going to play. Therefore, the main lines of work focus on the following:A new technology stack to offer customers services that are more suited to their needs, in terms of timing and content.Alliances with strategic partners to harness cutting-edge technology, and the necessary collaboration to speed up the transformation process.Productivity and reliability, i.e. securing improved performance from technology, and doing so in a manner that is fully reliable and guarantees the highest quality standards.New technology stack: cloud paradigmsWith customers increasingly making use of digital channels, and therefore driving an exponential increase in transaction numbers, the Group has developed its IT model into a more uniform and scalable system, boosting cloud technology.In 2016 Engineering has worked on constructing the fundamental building blocks of the technology stack that includes the entire BBVA Group and shares the cloud attributes such as flexibility and stability that are demanded by the digital world, while strictly complying with regulatory requirements. This new stack will enable real-time access, a new approach to data management and the optimization of processing costs, meaning customers benefit from a service that caters directly to their needs.Strategic alliancesEngineering has driven creation of a network of strategic alliances, giving traction to BBVA’s digital transformation and complementing its technology stack. Establishing an ecosystem of strategic alliances with some of the leading businesses in the market ensures the adoption of innovative technologies, business digitalization and promptness, deployment and global operational solutions. Furthermore, by building a network of technological alliances with strategic partners, BBVA will work in close cooperation with some of the foremost companies in their respective fields, such as Salesforce, Red Hat, Amazon Web Services or Cisco.Productivity and reliabilityProductivity is one of the key aspects of the BBVA transformation process. Greater productivity is critical to providing our customers with the best service while being profitable. Engineering is therefore working on the following:Technology transformation at two levels:– Hardware: creating the components of the new infrastructure, redirecting demand to new models based on the cloud paradigm and progressive migration of traditional transactions.– Software: reusing functionalities and automating as many processes as possible.Transformation of operations with a multi-local focus, representing a new organizational approach to production and functions that optimizes processes.It is critical to obtain the best possible performance from infrastructures, architectures, operations and internal processes, and to do so in a way that is fully reliable. Reliability is another key factor for the Engineering function and digital transformation. Reliability must be at the heart of businesses, guaranteeing utmost quality standards; both internally, when providing service to other BBVA units, and from an external point of view, when providing a service to customers.Operational and technological risk managementMain security and customer protection initiativesOne standout initiative for the future in terms of the security and protection of technology channels is the complete account opening process via mobile devices, meaning customers do not have to go into a branch to open an account. This service has been designed pursuant to the directives of SEPBLAC (the Spanish’s Financial Unit and AML/CFT Supervisory Authority that reports to the Commission for the Prevention of Money Laundering and Monetary Infractions), and incorporates modern facial recognition technology, with capabilities to identify forged national identity cards. These technologies will be gradually incorporated into the most critical processes of our relationship with our customers via technological channels.Work has been carried out in the field of business continuity, meaning contingency plans for low-probability but extremely high-impact events. Business impact analysis has been updated and implemented, reviewing technology dependency on critical processes to improve service recovery in the event of IT system malfunction. Business continuity plans have also been activated in several incidents that have affected BBVA Group, such as the flooding of the Mapocho River affecting the Bank’s headquarters in Chile, social disturbances that affected the headquarters in Mexico and Venezuela, and the impact of Hurricane Mathew in the south of the United States.At the same time, digital transformation has established itself as a strategic priority for the financial sector in general and for BBVA in particular. In this context, it is vital that we ensure effective protection for BBVA’s brand and assets, as well as our customers’ data, from the threats present in the virtual environment. To achieve this, BBVA has created a reliable and efficient center for cyber-attack prevention, alerts and response. This ensures that the Group develops at the same pace as organized technological crime.BBVA has also consolidated deployment of the cybersecurity standard designed by NIST (National Institute for Standards and Technologies) as a benchmark framework for management and control.Finally, it is important to note that BBVA is utterly committed to protecting its customers. It therefore works closely with regulators and the rest of the industry across its global footprint.Customer Care Service and Customer OmbudsmanThe law governing the activities of the Customer Care Service and Customer Ombudsman in 2016 is determined under Article 17 of Ministerial Order ECO/734/2004 of March 11, issued by the Spanish Ministry of the Economy, governing customer care departments and services and the customer ombudsman in financial institutions. They are also subject to BBVA Group’s Customer Protection Charter in Spain, approved by the BBVA Board of Directors in 2015, which regulates the activities and powers of the Customer Care Service and Customer Ombudsman.Thus, BBVA’s Customer Care Service processes claims and complaints addressed to the Customer Ombudsman and, initially, to the Customer Care Service, except for matters falling within the powers of the Customer Ombudsman as established in the aforementioned Charter.Report on the activity of the Customer Care Service in SpainIn 2016, the Customer Care Service consolidated the initial guidelines issued in 2015 and, in keeping with the European guidelines on complaints established by the pertinent authorities (the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA)) worked on detecting recurring, system-related or potential problems at the Entity. Two key functions of the BBVA quality strategy are anticipation and root cause analysis. The Customer Care Service is one of the fundamental elements for identifying and proposing action plans to improve customer experience and comply with regulatory requirements.Customer claims and complaints received by the BBVA Customer Care Service in Spain amounted to 25,562 cases in 2016, of which 2,502 were not admitted for processing as they did not comply with the requirements stipulated in Ministerial Order ECO/734; 20,279 were resolved by the Customer Care Service itself and concluded in the same year (88% of the total). A further 2,781 cases were pending analysis. In 2015, the complaints received numbered 17,647 and the cases resolved and concluded 14,315 (92% of the total).Complaints handled by Customer Care Service by complaint typePercentage20162015Resources2426Assets products/ loans2720Insurances78Collection and payment services817Financial counselling and quality service79Credit cards109Securities and equity portfolios54Other127Total100100Download tableComplaints handled by Customer Care Service according to resolutionNumber20162015In favor of the person submitting the complaint7,0714,750Partially in favor of the person submitting the complaint2,8301,738In favor of the BBVA Group10,3787,827Total20,27914,315Download tableQuality governance has become one of the essential factors driving the corporate strategy and objectives defined for service quality. The various committees working on quality governance help improvement measures to be adopted in the areas in which errors or bad practices have been detected by creating work groups that operate with the support of the Bank’s senior management. In 2016, this Service proposed 73 improvement plans, of which 58 have already been implemented.The Customer Care Service continues to work through periodic committee meetings to unify criteria. The result of this work is an internal tool that groups together procedures, management criteria, standards, regulations and response models applicable to each type of case.Additionally, to comply with the recommendations from the regulators, an ambitious training plan has been created for all the members who are part of the Service’s team. The plan aims to broaden the legal understanding of managers while dealing in depth with the practical aspects of banking management: operational procedures, marketing and protocols for action in the retail network.In line with the demands of society, the Service is particularly sensitive to protection for mortgage debtors. It proposes solutions to enable debtors to pay their obligations to the Entity, working closely with the Social Housing Policy Department, where it is an active member of the Central Mortgage Debtor Protection Committee.The outsourcing last year of non-complex tasks of complaints admission and management was consolidated this year, resulting in more agile and justified responses, guaranteeing compliance with the guidelines.The complaints management tool implemented at the start of 2015 is now fully operational. It has become an essential element not only for the management of claims and complaints but also for root cause analysis.Moreover, the Network Quality and Internal Quality units were incorporated into Quality and Customer Care in 2016. The aim has been to generate a single quality model that would enable us to satisfy our strategic priority of providing a new standard in customer experience, incorporating a single vision that prevents inefficiency and dispersion.Activity report on the BBVA Group Customer Ombudsman in SpainThe number of customer complaints presented to the Customer Ombudsman for resolution in 2016 was 1,501. Of these, 100 were finally not processed as they did not meet the requirements set out in Ministerial Order ECO/734/2004; 91.7% of the complaints (1,377) were resolved and concluded within the year, with 24 cases pending further analysis.Complaints handled by the Customer Ombudsman by complaint typeNumber20162015Insurance and welfare product590459Assets operations305161Investment services14159Liabilities operations175101Other banking products (credit card, ATM, etc.)10048Collection and payment services6337Other127100Total1,501965Download tableThe type of complaints managed in the table above follow the criteria established by the Complaints Department of the Bank of Spain in their requests for information.Complaints handled by Customer Ombudsman according to resolutionNumber20162015In favor of the person submitting the complaint-2Partially in favor of the person submitting the complaint861544In favor of the BBVA Group516324Total1,377870Download table58.3% of the customers who submitted a complaint to the Ombudsman in 2016 reported some level of satisfaction either because of the decision of the Customer Ombudsman or its role as mediator between BBVA Group entities and customers.The Customer Ombudsman issues its decisions on the basis of legislation currently in force, the contractual relationships between the parties, current standards on transparency and customer protection, best banking practices and, in particular, the principle of fairness.The independent nature of the role of the Customer Ombudsman is essential. The decisions of the Ombudsman in favor of the customer are binding on Group entities.Among the actions taken by BBVA Group in 2016 in response to suggestions made by the Customer Ombudsman are the following:Adaptation of the product profile to the customer profile, particularly emphasizing the need to provide abundant correct information on the products offered to customers. To do so, the Group is employing the Transparent, Clear and Responsible (TCR) communication initiative for responsible banking, making as much data and documentation available as necessary.Progress in promoting compliance with transparency and customer protection legislation has been set as an essential objective to provide criteria and possible ways of improvement. Particular emphasis has been placed on its work of mediating between customers and compliant entities to reach amicable agreements within the established regulatory limits.Monthly Quality Committee meetings in collaboration with Quality, Legal Services and the Customer Care Service, and with the participation of the Group’s units and areas in Spain. The meetings debate and exchange problems, ideas and suggestions regarding complaints and claims submitted by customers for the purpose of improving the Group’s complaint system and contribute to better and more satisfactory customer care.Common objective of unifying criteria and enhancing the defense and security of customers. Regular meetings and contacts were held for this purpose with the Complaints Department of the Bank of Spain, the Spanish Securities and Investment Board (CNMV), and the Directorate General of Insurance and Pension Funds.Customers who are not satisfied with the Customer Ombudsman’s response may refer the matter to the official supervisory bodies (the Bank of Spain, CNMV and the Directorate General of Insurance and Pension Funds). The Customer Ombudsman always informs customers of this right.The number of complaints examined and/or resolved by the Customer Ombudsman that were then submitted to the supervisory bodies at the instigation of the customers in 2016 was 108.Offshore financial centersBBVA maintains a policy on activities in entities permanently registered in offshore financial centers, which includes a plan for reducing the number of offshore financial centers in which the Group is present.As of December 31, 2016, the BBVA Group’s permanent establishments registered in offshore financial centers considered tax havens are as follows:Branches of the BBVA Group’s banks in the Cayman Islands.Issuers of securities in the Cayman Islands: BBVA International, Ltd., BBVA Global Finance, Ltd., Continental DPR Finance Company, Garanti Diversified Payment Rights Finance Company and RPV Company.Branches of the BBVA Group’s banks inthe Cayman IslandsAs of December 31, 2016, the BBVA Group had two banking branches registered in the Cayman Islands engaging in Corporate Banking activities.
