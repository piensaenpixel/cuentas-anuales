<p><strong>Includes:</strong> Preferred stock and convertible perpetual securities and deductions</p>

<p><strong>Adjusted acquisition cost:</strong> The acquisition cost of the securities less accumulated amortizations, plus interest accrued, but not net of any other valuation adjustments.</p>

<p><strong>Amortized cost:</strong> The amortized cost of a financial asset is the amount at which it was measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus, as warranted, the cumulative amount taken to profit or loss using the effective interest rate method of any difference between the initial amount and the maturity amount, and minus any reduction for impairment or change in measured value.</p>

<p><strong>Associates:</strong> Companies in which the Group has a significant influence, without having control. Significant influence is deemed to exist when the Group owns 20% or more of the voting rights of an investee directly or indirectly.</p>

<p><strong>Available-for-sale financial assets:</strong> Available-for-sale (AFS) financial assets are debt securities that are not classified as held-tomaturity investments or as financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) and equity instruments that are not subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities and have not been designated as at FVTPL.</p>

<p><strong>Basic earnings per share:</strong> Calculated by dividing “Profit attributable to Parent Company” corresponding to ordinary shareholders of the entity by the weighted average number of shares outstanding throughout the year (i.e., excluding the average number of treasury shares held over the year).</p>

<p><strong>Basis risk:</strong> Risk arising from hedging exposure to one interest rate with exposure to a rate that reprices under slightly different conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Business combination:</strong> A business combination is a transaction, or any other event, through which a single entity obtains the control of one or more businesses.</p>

<p><strong>Cash flow hedges:</strong> Those that hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction and could affect profit or loss.</p>

<p><strong>Commissions:</strong> Income and expenses relating to commissions and similar fees are recognized in the consolidated income statement using criteria that vary according to their nature. The most significant income and expense items in this connection are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fees and commissions relating linked to financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, which are recognized when collected</li>
  <li>Fees and commissions arising from transactions or services that are provided over a period of time, which are recognized over the life of these transactions or services.</li>
  <li>Fees and commissions generated by a single act are accrued upon execution of that act.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Consolidated statements of cash flows:</strong> The indirect method has been used for the preparation of the consolidated statement of cash flows. This method starts from the entity’s consolidated profit and adjusts its amount for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments, and items of income or expense associated with cash flows classified as investment or finance. As well as cash, shortterm, highly liquid investments subject to a low risk of changes in value, such as cash and deposits in central banks, are classified as cash and equivalents. When preparing these financial statements the following definitions have been used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cash flows: Inflows and outflows of cash and equivalents.</li>

Conversely, if the entity holds, directly or indirectly (i.e. through subsidiaries), less than 20 per cent of the voting power of the investee, it is presumed that the entity does not have significant influence, unless such influence can be clearly demonstrated. A substantial or majority ownership by another investor does not necessarily preclude an entity from having significant influence. The existence of significant influence by an entity is usually evidenced in one or more of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a)     representation on the board of directors or equivalent governing body of the investee;</li>
  <li>b)      participation in policy-making processes, including participation in decisions about dividends or other distributions;</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Structured credit products:</strong> Special financial instrument backed by other instruments building a subordination structure.</p>

<p><strong>Structured Entities:</strong> A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements. A structured entity often has some or all of the following features or attributes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a)       restricted activities.</li>
  <li>b)     a narrow and well-defined objective, such as to effect a tax-efficient lease, carry out research and development activities, provide a source of capital or funding to an entity or provide investment opportunities for investors y passing on risks and rewards associated with the assets of the structured entity to investors.</li>
  <li>c)       insufficient equity to permit the structured entity to finance its activities without subordinated financial support.</li>
  <li>d)    financing in the form of multiple contractually linked instruments to investors that create concentrations of credit or other risks (tranches).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Subordinated liabilities:</strong> Financing received, regardless of its instrumentation, which ranks after the common creditors in the event of a liquidation.</p>

<p><strong>Subsidiaries:</strong> Companies over which the Group exercises control. An entity is presumed to have control over another when it possesses the right to oversee its financial and operational policies, through a legal, statutory or contractual procedure, in order to obtain benefits from its economic activities. Control is presumed to exist when the parent owns, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, more than one half of an entity’s voting power, unless, exceptionally, it can be clearly demonstrated that ownership of more than one half of an entity’s voting rights does not constitute control of it. Control also exists when the parent owns half or less of the voting power of an entity when there is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a)     an agreement that gives the parent the right to control the votes of other shareholders;</li>
  <li>b)     power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity under a statute or an agreement; power to appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board of directors or equivalent governing body and control of the entity is by that board or body;</li>
  <li>c)     power to cast the majority of votes at meetings of the board of directors or equivalent governing body and control of the entity is by that board or body.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tier 2 Capital:</strong> Includes: Subordinated, preferred shares, generic countable and non- controlling interest</p>

<p><strong>Unit-link:</strong> This is life insurance in which the policyholder assumes the risk. In these policies, the funds for the technical insurance provisions are invested in the name of and on behalf of the policyholder in shares of Collective Investment Institutions and other financial assets chosen by the policyholder, who bears the investment risk.</p>

<p><strong>Value at Risk (VaR):</strong> Value at Risk (VaR) is the basic variable for measuring and controlling the Group’s market risk. This risk metric estimates the maximum loss that may occur in a portfolio’s market positions for a particular time horizon and given confidence level.</p>

<p>VaR figures are estimated following two methodologies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘VaR without smoothing, which awards equal weight to the daily information for the immediately preceding last two years. This is currently the official methodology for measuring market risks vis-à-vis limits compliance of the risk.</li>
  <li>VaR with smoothing, which weights more recent market information more heavily. This is a metric which supplements the previous one.</li>
</ul>

<p>VaR with smoothing adapts itself more swiftly to the changes in financial market conditions, whereas VaR without smoothing is, in general, a more stable metric that will tend to exceed VaR with smoothing when the markets show less volatile trends, while it will tend to be lower when they present upturns in uncertainty.</p>

<p><strong>Yield curve risk:</strong> Risks arising from changes in the slope and the shape of the yield curve.</p>
